Ze Rat (Ze Cook): What the
Uncle Max: The university is publicly raising money to replace them lol
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Damn bois
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): No chill
Uncle Max: On top of the $100,000 fine from the SEC for storming the field
Uncle Max: I wonder if they‚Äôll have to relay the grass
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Lol what
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Holy smokes
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I'm watching the video from the goalpost river dump this is so dumb 
Uncle Max: Awwww yeah lol
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Is he in Georgia now
Uncle Max: Lol it‚Äôd be funnier if he wasn‚Äôt 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I'll check in 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Confirmed he is now in SW Georgia
Uncle Max: Dang
Uncle Max: We need to warn the local raccoon population
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): LOL
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): "And the neighbors being God-fearing people thought there was a pack or Satanists running around"
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Of*
B2EMO: null
B2EMO: null
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): GOOOOOOOOD
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Apparently the St. Ann youth group does midday prayer every time they have youth group pog
B2EMO: who runs the youth group
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Idk
B2EMO: The small groups are dead üíÄ  
B2EMO: null
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Oof
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): All those young adults flocked to St. Ann and said "yes we want all the community" but when they were actually offered community they said "nah"
B2EMO: I need to remind David that vespers and dinner is happening tonight 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Yes
B2EMO: Done 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Yeyeye
B2EMO: Join me David and together we can rule as ann young adult leaders 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Nah Miranda is the one in charge 
B2EMO: Lol true 
Uncle Max: St Ann‚Äôs young adults small groups ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Uncle Max: Joniak when the small groups he created don‚Äôt work
Uncle Max: Fr Fye after he hears Joniak is abandoning the small groups
B2EMO: I would bet all the money I don't have that David won't come tonight  
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): LOL
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): What's the status on that
Uncle Max: Pof
Uncle Max: Oof*
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Pof
B2EMO: Status is I'm still waiting 
B2EMO: $$$$$
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): As a reward for being right, you can have the lint in the cash pocket of my wallet
B2EMO: They all say they want community 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I mean David is doing better than most at engaging in community especially for being newly wed 
B2EMO: That's true his heart is in the right place 
B2EMO: But at the same time, I think he wants to cash out of the young adult community (at least not lead part of it) now that he is married 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): In fairness he has been doing like 90% of the lifting because young adults are flakes so I could understand why if that's the case
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I'd be burnt out and over it
B2EMO: True 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Especially after being laid off his job right before his wedding
B2EMO: Really I didn‚Äôt know that 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Yeah they cut him like the day before I think he's still unemployed right now
B2EMO: Man that sucks 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Yep
B2EMO: Off to NSS for him 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): LOL
B2EMO: I wonder if anyone from small group will show up tonight 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Hahahahaha
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): U funny
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I don't have very high hopes for that given what you've said about their small group participation. But they know it's a thing now and that's the best we can do.
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): That's more mouths that can potentially spread the word
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Why don't we keep track of who we invite versus who actually comes and then we can start figuring a ratio lol
B2EMO: null
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): If we can figure an invite to show up ratio then maybe we can roughly estimate how many people we need to invite to increase numbers
Uncle Max: It‚Äôs not about numbers :)
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Boi
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): You know what I mean
Uncle Max: ?
Uncle Max: I don‚Äôt
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Actually I don't either I'm cracked out
Uncle Max: Nice
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Get a load of the monkey
B2EMO: It‚Äôs not about number but at the same time we want more people to come does that checkout  
Uncle Max: You can‚Äôt speak to me in metaphors
Uncle Max: I take things literally
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): But you're Uncle Max not Timon
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Offbrand
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I think what my ADHD brain was trying to say was if we understand roughly the turnover is then we know how wide to cast the net
Uncle Max: @Ze Rat (Ze Cook) No offense, but I hate this mindset
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): null
Uncle Max: To boil down to X amount of people that we invited show up and then say ‚Äúwell if we want this amount of people to show up then we need to invite this amount of people‚Äù makes it about the numbers
B2EMO: Just invite people and Ôøºencourage other to invite people and who ever shows up shows up
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Ah whatever
Uncle Max: Not all of these invitations are the same. When Matthew re invites Ryan every week, it‚Äôs totally different than Camden sending something in a small group chat, which is totally different than me inviting Pete last night over dinner. To put the same value on them as ‚Äúone invitation‚Äù is misleading and not helpful to the actual community that we‚Äôre trying to grow
Uncle Max: This is one of my biggest gripes with FOCUS is that they have to report bible study attendance and invitations each week
Uncle Max: And then they make decisions for the studies based on those numbers
Uncle Max: Naptime
Uncle Max: For Babbitto
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I'm not discussing it anymore 
B2EMO: Ryan the chad is here early 
Uncle Max: I am running late but I am on my way
B2EMO: @Ze Rat (Ze Cook) @2004 Auburn Tigers

Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I've literally never heard a worse take lol
