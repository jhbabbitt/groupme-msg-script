Tidehunter: $2,150 right?
The Rental Magnet: I haven't done anything yet
The Rental Magnet: But it's listed at 2175
The Rental Magnet: What should I tell her our move date is what are y'all putting @Tidehunter @Ymir da Tursk 
Ymir da Tursk: I cannot move in until April 18th or 19th at the absolute earliest
Ymir da Tursk: However, I’m willing to start the lease earlier than that and just not move in until then
The Rental Magnet: Are you also ok with price Jacob
Ymir da Tursk: Yes
The Rental Magnet: 2175 split 3 ways comes out to about 730 a person not including utilities 
Ymir da Tursk: Is @Tidehunter contributing more for a bigger room or are all the rooms the same
Ymir da Tursk: I’m fine either way
The Rental Magnet: We havent figured that put because the upstairs room is technically bigger but it has less air circulation and  is kinda weird 
The Rental Magnet: I'll give you full disclosure working at 13 an hour paying 500 a month with no utilities was comfortable but sometimes I was frustrated with not being able to spend my money in certain circumstances
The Rental Magnet: But I also pay my own phone bill and car insurance not sure how that factors for you
The Rental Magnet: I just don't want you to expect finances to be one thing and get another is all
Tidehunter: @The Rental Magnet If you want the upstairs room it’s your I don’t care if you pay more or not but I don’t want the upstairs 
The Rental Magnet: Lol I knew it
The Rental Magnet: I could feel it from the way you talked about it
Ymir da Tursk: Yeah, don’t worry about me financially
Ymir da Tursk: I’ve considered getting another job once I move and stuff like that
The Rental Magnet: Dont submit applications until I get confirmation @Tidehunter @Ymir da Tursk 
The Rental Magnet: The paper makes it clear that the date should be approved first
The Rental Magnet: I told her the 23rd and said we could also move earlier just prep your apps and be ready to go
The Rental Magnet: Also we will need a cashier's check or money order prepped because it says it's due 24 hours after approval of applications
Tidehunter: I can do the cashiers check deposit with usaa when we need it 
The Rental Magnet: Beeeaauuuutiful
Tidehunter: Me at midnight when we are moving in

One Lead Paint Boi: Looked it up the going price for that Valkyrie box set is 30 bucks lol
Ymir da Tursk: Aye lads so assuming we are getting the house
Ymir da Tursk: Would it be beneficial to y’all if we just kept the uhaul I’m renting an extra day or whatever so that y’all can move y’all’s stuff in it
One Lead Paint Boi: Oh shoot yeah
One Lead Paint Boi: I can help pitch in
Ymir da Tursk: So I just rent one, bring it up with my stuff, and then we just use it to ferry all of y’all’s stuff over
One Lead Paint Boi: Ye
One Lead Paint Boi: And I pay you 2 dollar
One Lead Paint Boi: null
Ymir da Tursk: 2 dollar?!?!?!?
Ymir da Tursk: Gotta be $2.75
One Lead Paint Boi: 3 dollar final offer
Ymir da Tursk: null
One Lead Paint Boi: Ok I concede 
One Lead Paint Boi: 5 dollar
One Lead Paint Boi: This is my best offer 
Tidehunter: I was going to have my dad/sean/ben lh help me move with their trucks
One Lead Paint Boi: Mr. Independent here
One Lead Paint Boi: Ben is beyond out of control in my opinion
One Lead Paint Boi: Something must be done
Tidehunter: Are you just realizing that? I'm not sure what can be done about it? 
Ymir da Tursk: What happened
One Lead Paint Boi: Tbh I thought you were exaggerating because you have a lower tolerance for annoyance @Tidehunter 
One Lead Paint Boi: He's trying to take control of Joey now and persuade to do Latin everything and be a monastic
One Lead Paint Boi: He apparently told Peter Martin not to make Joey Grand Knight because he thinks he'll be too busy. But Joey has been working toward that from the beginning
One Lead Paint Boi: And then he also wants to do FOCUS but only on his terms which is just a one year commitment not the 2 year required
One Lead Paint Boi: I just don't think Ben is properly discerning his vocation nor is he properly channeling his wants and needs 
Tidehunter: Yes, that's true I've had a low tolerance. But I wasn't exaggerating.￼ It’s gotten to the point where it's so annoying. 
One Lead Paint Boi: Yeah I know I'm backing you up here I made an incorrect assumption
One Lead Paint Boi: I'm checking my email every chance I get lol
Tidehunter: Yeah, it's hard because this has been building up over the years. Elizabeth is no longer there to keep him in check. From my point of view is that he has surrounded himself with people who enable his viewpoint. ￼
One Lead Paint Boi: From my point of view the non-Latin speakers are evil
One Lead Paint Boi: null
