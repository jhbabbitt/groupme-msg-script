Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Talked to Darla just now about quitting. Went well overall. Leaving Publix stock has hit an all time high
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: She was basically like ‚Äúthis sucks but it makes sense because they don‚Äôt pay you enough‚Äù
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Apparently she‚Äôs been fighting to give me a raise and the store manager has been saying no lol
Wasabi Juan: OOOOFFFF
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Which makes me wonder if the store manager will offer me anything to try to keep me. Obviously they can‚Äôt pay me enough to keep me, like the max they could pay me isn‚Äôt enough to compare to post NSS grad starting jobs
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: But also now I am leverage for Darla to get her other key employees paid more, which is a good meme

Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Idk that's up to Matthew
Wasabi Juan: 6:00 maybe it kinda depends if I‚Äôm getting wings
