奈良シカマル: Oh
Major Armstrong: For you or for someone else? @Tech 
Tech:  For me I had some minor chest pain so I went to the walk in clinic then they sent me to the ER 
奈良シカマル: Keep us updated
Tech: Just in the waiting room. They took my vitals and said I looked good 
Tech: So idk
Major Armstrong: I’m going to go ahead and eat dinner, we can go get Smiling Elephant some other time. Any objections?
Tech:  That works 
Tech: I’m coming home 
Tech: I will be having a interview at 9:30 @奈良シカマル 
奈良シカマル: Aye
奈良シカマル: I heard that chuckle all the way up here
奈良シカマル: That was like a 2 grand chuckle
Tech: More then at 
Major Armstrong: Oof

Major Armstrong: Add it to the wedding playlist
奈良シカマル: Right after Across the Stars
奈良シカマル: @Tech wanna watch Black Widow?
Tech: Sure 
奈良シカマル: yayyyy 
奈良シカマル: You're also welcome to join @Major Armstrong just didn't know if you'd be interested
奈良シカマル: Oh wait lol he ain't here 
奈良シカマル: I forgot
Major Armstrong: Not gone yet gotta run home and grab my stuff and do a couple things real quick
Tech: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOIaVnqEWg
奈良シカマル: Y'all I have so much food I'm bringing home from this restaurant 
奈良シカマル: The catch is it has both beef and octopus in it hehehehe
奈良シカマル: Down with the Empire
奈良シカマル: We march on Solitude 
Major Armstrong: All hail to Ulfric! You are the high king! In your great honor we drink and we sing!
奈良シカマル: I understand this reference now
奈良シカマル: Also the memes are real y'all they're trying to offer me an executive position now at Chick-fil-A
Major Armstrong: Lol
奈良シカマル: Susan asked me what the jobs in music are paying and I told her and she said "I can do much better"
奈良シカマル: Like they are legitimately coming after mew
Major Armstrong: Oof 
Tech: Lol
Major Armstrong: So what’s the play
Major Armstrong: @奈良シカマル 
奈良シカマル: The move is to talk to Miranda first 
Major Armstrong: Fair
奈良シカマル: I said my end goal is the music industry but if they wanted to get me the training I needed to do data analytics and look at the business's numbers and would be okay with maybe 4 or 5 years max from me I would definitely consider it
奈良シカマル: If I can get the experience and training it's a win for my career if you ask me
Major Armstrong: Should be home in about 2 hours lads
Major Armstrong: Prayers because the weather is pretty bad
Major Armstrong: I think I’ve made it through the worst of it though
Major Armstrong: I am off at 2 on Friday if we’re still trying to host Will
奈良シカマル: Yes he said he would love Friday
奈良シカマル: What shall we make our very good friend Mr. Braeuner
Tech: I’m going into a meeting @奈良シカマル 
Tech: One sad boi @奈良シカマル 
奈良シカマル: Wanna do burgers @Tech 
Tech: Sure 
奈良シカマル: Awwwww yeah 
Tech: We can not keep the door to the basement open their are way to many flies getting in 
奈良シカマル: The flies are also coming in because we're leaving food around so if we want to get rid of them I would suggest we collectively make an effort to clean after we make food
奈良シカマル: They can smell it from outside the house probably
奈良シカマル: Okay someone is just trying to mess with me now I just got another music industry interview after this whole dry spell and after I started talking with Chick-fil-A about a salaried position
奈良シカマル: Well dang guess I have an interview in 2 hours 
奈良シカマル: They said I've been selected for an HR interview and they've already selected me for the hiring manager interview but I still have to do the HR interview
Major Armstrong: HMMMMM
Tech: Big sus 
奈良シカマル: I'm a very very particular fit for this role though because it plays to literally all my strengths and experiences in my internships so that might be a part of it
奈良シカマル: The royalty software they use is one I had to use every day at my first internship
奈良シカマル: Interview aced second one coming atcha on Tuesday 
奈良シカマル: I went to prison just to try breaking out
奈良シカマル: And I freaking wrote over my quicksave during my escape so now it's on record lol
奈良シカマル: Final tally of flies swatted for the night: 16
奈良シカマル: Which is a meme yes but also a sign that we need to step it up in the kitchen area
Tech: I swatted 10 last night 
奈良シカマル: Refer to previous message
Tech: Your not seeing the real solution. Doom music intensifies.
Major Armstrong: Do not shoot in face or eyes
奈良シカマル: Lol bet
奈良シカマル: https://youtu.be/T12ygsp9Mvg
Tech: null
奈良シカマル: Hahahahahahahahahaha
奈良シカマル: So here's my game plan. Jacob and I (or just me idk) can grab our ingredients for tonight. I will take care of vegetable prep and side items. Jacob can do table setting and tidy up whatever I haven't gotten to.
奈良シカマル: Will is arriving around 5 so once you're off Matthew you can drop those hamburger patties so they'll be fresh
奈良シカマル: I need to run a quick errand at 4/4:15 ish but should be back by 4:45
Tech: I can get all the ingredients for the burgers if @奈良シカマル  you want get the food for sides that would work 
奈良シカマル: Let's go fancy with the toppings 
Tech: Like what? 
奈良シカマル: Avocado, sauteed mushroom
奈良シカマル: Maybe some pepperjack in addition to cheddar cheese
奈良シカマル: I'd like to buy a bunch of romaine and make the lettuce from scratch
奈良シカマル: Oh we can't forget bacon either
Major Armstrong: @Tech @奈良シカマル the bakery made really really good bread today so I got burger buns and a French bread. We don’t have to use them if we don’t want
Tech: Definitely get the burger buns ￼
奈良シカマル: When Matthew turns left out of the driveway instead of right
奈良シカマル: I caught some traffic on the way so I might be cutting it close coming back
奈良シカマル: Ok Jacob is on entertainment duty
奈良シカマル: You can show Will all the exciting fauna living in our house while the food is still being made
