Ze Rat (Ze Cook): LOL
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I also didn't sign up for randos sitting with me
B2EMO: Someone just needs say in the chat after the 11:00 a group is going to red bicycleï¿¼ to have brunch come or donâ€™t 
B2EMO: Same
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Ok Matthew let's see it
2004 Auburn Tigers: Or we can not say it in the chat and invite people via personal invitation
2004 Auburn Tigers: :)
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Nah bro gotta put the whole chat on blast so everyone can swipe away the notification 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): What this chat really needs is to have the pancake vs waffle debate introduced 
2004 Auburn Tigers: LOL
B2EMO: I think in this scenario the GroupMe can be used because we are trying to cast a bigger net 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): What was the other huge debate that had to be shut down in Peter's Catholic Friends
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): That I was probably the source of
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Wait...am I the problem? No that can't be right.
B2EMO: I must work from the shadows but this would be perfect for Miranda to put in the chat lol
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Yeah but Red Bicycle after every Mass ain't in our budget
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Our eating out budget is going toward vespers
B2EMO: Iâ€™m not saying you guys have be there every  
week it more to just announce that is where people will be meeting up
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Hmmmmm 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): But I am just ze rat
2004 Auburn Tigers: This isnâ€™t all bad news though. Them saying they want things to happen organically (whether their ideas are practical or not) gives us room to work. And thatâ€™s ultimately all we need, and all the community needs. Idk about this sitting together nonsense, but as long as Joniak isnâ€™t trying to swing for the fences again with more small groups and inorganic activities, weâ€™re doing okay
B2EMO: Lol groups just keeps on giving today 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): No no no
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): No McCrucifer NO
B2EMO: Now I want to post Jacobâ€™s meme 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): McCrucifer the love expert pls no
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Matthew can we all just move to the Netherlands 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): We can live in a communal house by the windmills and the tulip fields and ride bikes to work
B2EMO: Dont tempt me ï¿¼
B2EMO: Maybe I could get Issac to post the meme 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): LOL
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Do it you won't 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I'd cry for days
B2EMO: I want to and donâ€™t at the same time
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I see which one won over lol
B2EMO: I want chaos 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): \ o /
B2EMO: I donâ€™t know if the big GroupMe would survive such a meme ï¿¼
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): The confrontational trads would probably come for Isaac's head
2004 Auburn Tigers: Plz no I donâ€™t believe in Isaacâ€™s abilities to keep its author a secret
B2EMO: Hey go tell Issac in trad lightly 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Nashville trads coming for Jacob after Isaac breaks under their interrogation, colorized, circa 2022
B2EMO: DED
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I knew you'd appreciate that lol
B2EMO: Such a funny meme 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): The fact that he's seriously considering it
