1978 Treebeard: Stay tuned for more Publix drama updates as the day goes on
Brother Bill: Uh oh
1978 Treebeard: @incompetent manager
Brother Bill: Assistant manager trying to explain to Jacob how to make bread
1978 Treebeard: LOL
1978 Treebeard: Basically the new bread has a SUPER wet dough, and so when you‚Äôre traying it up, you don‚Äôt want to use mineral oil, because it mixes into the dough too easily and can cause problems. But when you put it on the baking screens (done mixing and everything), it stick to the paper SUPER bad, so I asked Darla a couple weeks ago if it comes off the paper easy and she said, yea, I can use a release spray (Pam) so it could come off easier after baking.
1978 Treebeard: Well Charlotte came at me this morning about how I can‚Äôt use any oil or anything but I‚Äôm not mixing it in any oil, I‚Äôm just using the release spray
1978 Treebeard: And idk what the official procedure says, but Darla told me to use the release spray, so we will say what the guide says later today
1978 Treebeard: Aaaaaand she just took an order for a bread we don‚Äôt regularly make

Brother Bill: A folder for Charlotte
1978 Treebeard: Welcome, Charlotte the assistant bakery manager, come to me through the fire of a 450¬∞F LMP industrial oven. Come, and look upon my perfect bread. Lay down your condescending tone of voice, it is not too late for my mercy. Look upon the Publix Bakery R&P guide, and see how I have done exactly as it has outlined. I‚Äôm Darla‚Äôs favorite, how can you kill Darla‚Äôs favorite? What a grand and intoxicating innocence. Everyday, I make perfect bread to feed the mongrel-dogs of Nashville so that they may eat. shame on you, sweet Charlotte, to accuse me of not making good bread.
Brother Bill: LOL
Brother Bill: Very very ded
Google Fiber Hater: DED
Brother Bill: In the land of Publix, where bakers toil,
There lived a humble soul named Jacob, loyal.
With flour on his hands and dough in his care,
He crafted bread, a labor he would share.

But troubles came upon his daily path,
In the form of Charlotte, assistant manager's wrath.
She criticized his every move, unjust,
From shaping loaves to his bread's crust.

"Jacob," she'd scold, with a venomous tone,
"You've erred again, your skills not fully honed.
Release spray on the bread, you fool," she cried,
Ignoring the manual, Jacob's guide.

Yet Darla, the manager, wise and fair,
Stood by Jacob, aware of Charlotte's snare.
She knew his dedication and baking art,
And defended him, playing her part.

"Charlotte," she said, her voice firm and clear,
"Jacob knows his craft, have no doubt or fear.
Trust in his skills, for he bakes with care,
Release spray or not, his loaves will be rare."
Brother Bill: Jacob, relieved by Darla's support,
Continued his work, with passion he sought.
He kneaded, he shaped, he baked with delight,
His loaves like golden treasures, a true sight. 

Charlotte, in her arrogance, soon realized,
That Jacob's skill could not be disguised.
Her criticisms fell on deafened ears,
As Jacob's talent silenced her fears. 

With each loaf that emerged, golden and grand,
Jacob's artistry flourished, taking command.
And Charlotte, humbled by her foolish pride,
Learned to respect the talent by her side. 

In the realm of Publix, a lesson was learned,
That true skill and dedication should be discerned.
For Jacob, the baker, had triumphed with grace,
And Charlotte, the critic, had found her rightful place. 

So let this tale echo through time and space,
A reminder of talent and its rightful embrace.
In the realm of bread, where flavors unite,
Jacob's artistry shone, bringing pure delight.
Google Fiber Hater: The legend of Jacob the baker will echo from age to age 
Brother Bill: Forget Ragnar the Red in with Jacob the Baker
1978 Treebeard: Lol
Brother Bill: Is it weird that I read this in the psalmody chant tone lol

Ever-bake food release spray: Basically there was a store manager who had an overnight shift, probably deep cleaning something or rearranging all the displays, and he locked himself out of the store at 2 AM somehow and so he texted Darla and was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you start early if you come let me in‚Äù
