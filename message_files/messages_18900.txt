Chris Castel: null
Trumpet 1 in C: And?
Trumpet 1 in C: Lol
Chris Castel: While Williams does take a lot of textures from pieces like Mars the Bringer of Wars or Rite of Spring I think there it's distinguished as inspiration rather than straight copying @Strider 
Trumpet 1 in C: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Trumpet 1 in C: He definitely knows what he‚Äôs doing, yes
Chris Castel: Duel of the Fates actually is similar to an earlier piece lemme see if I can find it
Trumpet 1 in C: He‚Äôs very musically literate. He knows a lot of music. He knows what sounds good and why it sounds good. And he uses those things that composers have done before him that work and incorporate them into his pieces. He just does it in a way that‚Äôs too close for some people‚Äôs comfort
Chris Castel: I mean
Strider: I don't know anything music
Chris Castel: People take issue with him using the "Holst chords" but I don't think Gustav Holst reserved those chords
Strider: about*
Chris Castel: Pretty sure Williams said "that sounds grand and epic and dramatic and I think that works well for what George wants"
Trumpet 1 in C: @Strider You would be able to tell if you were able to listen to one after the other
Chris Castel: Listen to the ending of Mars, the Bringer of War and the end of The Battle of Yavin
