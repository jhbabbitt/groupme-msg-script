Strider: The book of Sirach is so good 
Tom Bombadil: But then the Prottys said “Yeet”
Tom Bombadil: And they dumpstered it for not having the original in Hebrew
Strider: isn't most of the new testament written Greek
Tom Bombadil: Yes but that’s the original language of the text
Tom Bombadil: It’s entirely Greek if I’m not mistaken
Strider: man this a rabbit hole have to do with Martin Luther, who to define canon and what books are inspired
Tom Bombadil: Yeah it can seem complicated, but ultimately it boils down to do you trust the magisterium or not
Strider: True
Tom Bombadil: I could be wrong about this, but Protestants often appeal to the Vulgate because it’s missing some of the “apocryphal” books. Which is ironic because they don’t want to use the Vulgate for literally everything else
Treebeard: "This is our chat"
Treebeard: Oh, I don't think so
Treebeard: @Tom Bombadil

Treebeard: COVID-19 executed Order 66
Strider: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
Strider: Interactive mao
Strider: map
Treebeard: I feel like this is only happening because no one in the Western world took it seriously enough to use common sense preventative measures
Strider: yeah maybe
Treebeard: Meanwhile down here in Peru nobody cares about coronavirus
Treebeard: They're just livin
Strider: Peru currently has 19 cases of COVID-19
Treebeard: The locals say most of those have been isolated travelers and that they aren't concerned
Treebeard: So idk
Treebeard: At this point it's a question of when more than if and Peru is faring well in terms of rate and mortality
Treebeard: Did y'all hear that Vandy closed student housing completely and sent everyone home? Everyone has to move off their campus.
Strider: Yeah I mean the thing is that thing is that its most likely going to stay like this or get worse in the next 6 months with how fast its spreading
Treebeard: Bobby and Co tend to follow big brother Vanderbilt so I wouldn't be surprised if Belmont follows suit. Which will complicate a lot for my career future.
Treebeard: Yeah its blazing across the US
Treebeard: Now would be the ideal time for us to revisit the Trappist life idea boys
Strider: lol
Tom Bombadil: Yeah but I doubt they’re letting many visitors in right now
Treebeard: I've got an ear to the abbot 
Tom Bombadil: @Treebeard Carthusians would be better
Treebeard: BUT BOURBON FUDGE
Strider: I have heard a prediction that we could be about 15 days behind Italy
Strider: I could just be the east and west coast
Strider: that*
Tom Bombadil: How’s China doing right now
Treebeard: 80k+ cases last I heard
Treebeard: 3k+ deaths
Tom Bombadil: Shouldn’t we be tracking their progress to see when it’ll calm down here? Or no? 
Strider: 80,932 cases
Strider: 3,172 Deaths
Tom Bombadil: Also their healthcare is more questionable than ours
Tom Bombadil: So I’m theory we should have a quicker turnaround than them
Tom Bombadil: I also have no idea what I’m talking about though lol
Treebeard: But China also a different animal entirely because their government is inefficient, self-serving, and quick to distort truth
Strider: who knows
Treebeard: Which is part of the reason this epidemic hit the East so bad
