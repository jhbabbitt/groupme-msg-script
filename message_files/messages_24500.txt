One Habakkuk boi: Wait start from the beginning
One Python Boi: ?????? 
One Habakkuk boi: ⬆️
One Habakkuk boi: What matthew said
One Python Boi: DRAMA!!!!!
One Sid Meier boi: Mary wore a very short dress to EMHC
One Sid Meier boi: The Vandy board asked Colin to send out the following email
One Sid Meier boi: null
One Sid Meier boi: Brenton left the GroupMe for BCC and Peter's Catholic Friends
One Sid Meier boi: I asked Isaac and he said it was about the email and that Brenton said he did it "out of prudence"
One Habakkuk boi: I’m still confused but no longer by your explanation
One Sid Meier boi: By what?
One Habakkuk boi: Why leave GroupMe’s
One Python Boi: Oh Brenton 
One Habakkuk boi: That doesn’t make sense
One Python Boi: He is trying to make some kid of statement 
One Python Boi: Kind*
One Python Boi: Did Mary leave? 
One Sid Meier boi: Brenton really just cares more about Mary than anyone else in UCat now
One Habakkuk boi: Idk that seems kind of childish for Brenton
One Sid Meier boi: She has not left
One Habakkuk boi: It’s gotta be much deeper than that
One Sid Meier boi: I don't get it either especially for BCC like sure UCat even if that's weird I understand
One Habakkuk boi: Right?
One Sid Meier boi: Idk
One Habakkuk boi: Like, it seems like something he would do if he was wronged more than once
One Sid Meier boi: null
One Sid Meier boi: That's what I'm working off
One Habakkuk boi: Sure, I get leaving a GroupMe if you don’t like what’s happening there and it’s going to ruin your day or help you make bad decisions. That’s prudent. But I don’t see the connection between the GroupMe’s and the email
One Sid Meier boi: Right?
One Sid Meier boi: And furthermore no one in Belmont Catholic was involved in that
One Habakkuk boi: Exactly, which leads me to believe it goes much deeper than this
One Habakkuk boi: Maybe that was the tipping point or whatever
One Habakkuk boi: Idk
One Sid Meier boi: They have been going to Holy Name all semester
One Python Boi: Grrrr I’m at a tech meet up but this is spicy 
One Habakkuk boi: Except for when Mary is a Eucharistic minister
One Sid Meier boi: Yes
One Habakkuk boi: Do we know if they’re registered for Awakening
One Sid Meier boi: Negative according to Miranda
One Python Boi: Brenton has this really idealistic idea of who everyone should act  
One Habakkuk boi: Well Mary has never gone before
One Sid Meier boi: The only thing he has done with us is come to Isaac's Bible study
One Python Boi: Doesn’t surprise me  
One Habakkuk boi: He’s obviously fed up with something
One Habakkuk boi: Or Mary is and he’s just along for the ride
One Python Boi: I might try to talk to him 
One Habakkuk boi: If you do, be careful
One Habakkuk boi: The last thing he probably wants to hear right now is this whole situation
One Habakkuk boi: At least if I were him that’s how I’d feel
One Python Boi: Shoot
One Habakkuk boi: Lol or maybe he does want to talk about it
One Habakkuk boi: Yikes
One Habakkuk boi: GLHF
One Python Boi: Ooooffff why me 
One Sid Meier boi: Idk what GroupMe is doing but I can't see any messages 
One Python Boi: I’m meeting with Brenton to talk about  this pray for me 
One Sid Meier boi: Oh now I see it
One Sid Meier boi: Yikes
One Sid Meier boi: This still doesn't sound like Brenton though
One Sid Meier boi: It sounds like he's honing in on this as a direct attack on Mary
One Habakkuk boi: Oh yeah there’s no doubt
One Python Boi: Well I’m done talking to Brenton 
One Sid Meier boi: I need more context hold up
One Sid Meier boi: As in you finished a conversation?
One Python Boi: Yes 
One Sid Meier boi: Lol out of context it sounded like you could have meant you were just never gonna talk to Brenton again
One Python Boi: One very complex conversation 
One Sid Meier boi: Oh
One Python Boi: That basically boils to where do you draw the line with modesty 
One Python Boi: But it was good and he had a lot of good points 
One Python Boi: https://twitter.com/jacksonwolford/status/1182052211318312960
One Python Boi: Brenton's older brother basically explains Brenton's point of view its in a twitter thread I dont know why it's showing just one tweet
One Sid Meier boi: Yeah I read that tweet and I have thoughts 
One Sid Meier boi: Especially because he literally compares modesty for EMHCs to masturbation
One Python Boi: I would recommend reading the thread
One Sid Meier boi: I have already I looked it up when you sent that screenshot
One Sid Meier boi: I understand the point of view but I disagree with the logic used to get there
One Python Boi: oh yeah
One Python Boi: I feel like its just like well what is modesty
One Sid Meier boi: The thing I don't like is that this whole argument for one ignores the fact that the email was not just about skirt length and was quoting a previously established guideline
One Sid Meier boi: But for two also does not consider the other side and makes several assumptions, including immediately assigning blame to Fr. G exclusively
One Sid Meier boi: I don't even know what happened but I'm fairly confident that this was the result of several things that were noticed, as we've had other things such as lectures wearing jean shorts to lector
One Sid Meier boi: Lectors*
One Python Boi: Brenton seemed to just be focused on the skirt but he wasn't really mad a Fr. G but doesn't agree with him. I told him that he should talk to Fr G about why he did this and voice his point of view.
One Habakkuk boi: It’s tough any way you slice it
One Python Boi: But man Brenton was one mad boi
One Sid Meier boi: I worry more than anything that Brenton isn't thinking about this rationally just because it involves Mary
One Habakkuk boi: Idk, I trust Brenton to think with his head over his heart than I trust most people
One Habakkuk boi: Props to him for standing up for his SO if he feels like it’s the right thing to do
One Habakkuk boi: Idk if I have those guts
One Habakkuk boi: Regardless if he’s right or wrong
One Python Boi: I asked him directly about Mary and he would still be just as upset
One Sid Meier boi: It all seems decidedly un-nuanced
One Sid Meier boi: That's what I take issue with
One Habakkuk boi: I just hope that everybody acts with grace and understanding whenever this comes to a head. This could be a really good thing for Brenton and Mary in the long run
One Habakkuk boi: And the community for that matter
One Python Boi: But apparently this has upset the girls
One Habakkuk boi: What girls
One Python Boi: So far I know of Mary and Elizabeth
