I Want Pictures of Spiderman: She wasn't as enthralled as I was
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: Maybe it is kinda weird to excitedly say "I almost died!"

Darth Plagueis the Wise: Why are you an inspiration and did that correlate with you getting there phone number
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: Dammit Jacob
Jacob Babbitt: No I got no phone numbers
Jacob Babbitt: Unlucky
Darth Plagueis the Wise: I see through the lies of Jacob
Jacob Babbitt: It’s sort of a long story about the inspiration part but basically the drama and mass reverence 
Jacob Babbitt: Shut up matthew
Jacob Babbitt: I prayed after mass like I always do and a couple girls thought it was the coolest thing ever
Darth Plagueis the Wise: nice
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: null
