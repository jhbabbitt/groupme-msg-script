Librarian Jocasta Nu: I'll listen 
Trumpet 1 in C: Stop it lol @Librarian Jocasta Nu 
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Hahahaha tell the story
Trumpet 1 in C: Hang on I’m getting food
Librarian Jocasta Nu: NOURISH US FIRST
Trumpet 1 in C: So she’s a new Publix employee
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Matthew needs his chuckle of the day 
Trumpet 1 in C: Been here a week or two
Librarian Jocasta Nu: null
Strider: null
Trumpet 1 in C: So yesterday when she got off she bought some things and came through my line
Trumpet 1 in C: Normal
Trumpet 1 in C: But like, an hour later she came BACK to the store, bought more things, and came through my line again
Trumpet 1 in C: And this time she was like “oh we haven’t met, I’m Alyssa” whatever
Trumpet 1 in C:  Wait no
Trumpet 1 in C: This all happened Saturday
Trumpet 1 in C: My bad my bad
Trumpet 1 in C: SATURDAY
Trumpet 1 in C: And then she asked me if I worked Monday, which was weird, because we just met, not friends, why does she care if I work Monday. Well when I said no she was clearly disappointed and I knew right then what was up
Strider: Shoot dude
Librarian Jocasta Nu: El oh el
Librarian Jocasta Nu: It's so ironic that this happens to the man discerning religious life hahahaha
Trumpet 1 in C: So today, 9 AM I walk into the store. I’m going to clock in and right behind me is this other girl, Maegan. And before I can even clock in Maegan is like “JACOB!”
Trumpet 1 in C: Which we don’t have that relationship where she can be excited to see me either
Trumpet 1 in C: And I said oh no
Trumpet 1 in C: Mind you, I haven’t clocked in yet, and Maegan goes, in FRONT OF OTHER COWORKERS “hey Jacob what do you think of Alyssa???”
Trumpet 1 in C: And I said “idk I literally just met her the other day she seems nice”
Librarian Jocasta Nu: OOOOOOOOOF
Librarian Jocasta Nu: That's uncomfy 
Trumpet 1 in C: And so not only is there something here, but we’re going to act like 7th graders about it
Trumpet 1 in C: And Maegan says well she thinks you’re really cute and wants to have your phone number
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Then you said "I'm going to the Holy Land for half a year" right
Strider: Damn 
Trumpet 1 in C: She said and shes working later today so you should give it to her
Strider: * going to retake the holy land 
Trumpet 1 in C: So at that point I decided to shut this down via Alyssa and just leave Maegan out of it. So I said something like “I’ll keep that in mind” or something
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Oh heck
Trumpet 1 in C: But then in comes Alyssa just to buy stuff 4+ hours before her shift
Trumpet 1 in C: And here she comes through my line
Trumpet 1 in C: Of course
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Oh no
Trumpet 1 in C: And she says something super awkward like “what do you do in your free time” or something
Strider: Ooooofffff
Trumpet 1 in C: And I wanted to be like “PRACTICE CELEBACY”
Trumpet 1 in C: But I didn’t
Trumpet 1 in C: And so as she left she wrote her number on her receipt and gave it to Maegan who gave it to me
Trumpet 1 in C: So here we are
Librarian Jocasta Nu: What the FLIP
Trumpet 1 in C: So now I’m off to break this girls heart because She comes in while I’m still here so if I don’t do it now it’s going to be weird when she comes in
Trumpet 1 in C: It’s going to be awkward for her anyway but might as well rip off the bandaid
Librarian Jocasta Nu: SHOOT dude 
Librarian Jocasta Nu: This is still going on?
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Oh jeeeez
Strider: null
Trumpet 1 in C: I told Maegan that I’m discerning after she gave me her number. Just to let her know she failed XD
Librarian Jocasta Nu: Awwwwwwww YEAH
Strider: Lol covert her 
Strider: Convert *
Trumpet 1 in C: I’ll offer her friendship for sure
Trumpet 1 in C: I mean, why not be her friend
Librarian Jocasta Nu: This whole thing got me like
Trumpet 1 in C: This is a level 10 yikerz boys
Strider: True Extra points if she becomes a nun or sister 
Librarian Jocasta Nu: I've only had one woman in work come onto me and I don't even like to think of that
Strider: I’ve never had something like this happen
