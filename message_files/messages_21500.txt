Is it lent yet: null

Is it lent yet: Lol
Supreme Chancellor: that's a lot of war
Is it lent yet: I‚Äôm in the atomic era
Finally Got My Shirts: Are they? Because you're Korea and typically they zoom in science 
Finally Got My Shirts: Korea is built for science victory it's ridiculous 
Is it lent yet: Which would‚Äôve happened by now if I hadn‚Äôt been at war this entire freaking game
Finally Got My Shirts: Sounds like somebody doesn't know how to play diplomacy tsk 
Finally Got My Shirts: Mongolia and the Huns are weird in that if you war with them and beat them they will respect you more 
Is it lent yet: They‚Äôre on the other continent
Finally Got My Shirts: Hmmmm 
Finally Got My Shirts: Who's with you?
Is it lent yet: Dido and Napoleon
Is it lent yet: Dido is super aggro and idk why
Finally Got My Shirts: Ok well Dido and Napoleon are some of the more competitive victory civs 
Finally Got My Shirts: How many cities do you have?
Finally Got My Shirts: You shoulda gone for friendship with Askia and Gandhi both are pretty loyal and have low deception bias
Finally Got My Shirts: Napoleon and Dido however...lol
Is it lent yet: Really if I can just get Dido off my back I‚Äôll be okay
Finally Got My Shirts: Ok but how much expansion 
Finally Got My Shirts: Dido is decently diplomatic so if you negotiate well you can push her off but her deception bias is the same as Attila's lol
Finally Got My Shirts: Also decently willing for friendship 
Finally Got My Shirts: If you have over three cities with Korea you're probably picking Napoleon and Dido off and not playing to Korea's science strength 
Is it lent yet: I just have 3
Finally Got My Shirts: Ticking them off* it sounds like you're definitely not picking them off lol
Finally Got My Shirts: Looks like RNG just made them super aggressive lol

Is it lent yet: Damn racists
Finally Got My Shirts: You have to let your reputation settle by pleasing them
Finally Got My Shirts: Napoleon will be the easiest to reacquire the trust of
Finally Got My Shirts: Lol at this point
Is it lent yet: He was friendly and then the next turn denounced me lol
Finally Got My Shirts: Deception bias lol
Finally Got My Shirts: He and Attila are above average
Finally Got My Shirts: https://civdata.com/
Finally Got My Shirts: And Dido
Finally Got My Shirts: Gandhi is just gonna turtle and push science until he gets his nuke 
Finally Got My Shirts: But he's pretty willing to be friends if he doesn't hate you
Is it lent yet: Except for that one time he crossed the freaking ocean to invade me
Supreme Chancellor: Ok where is at the mute button? 
Finally Got My Shirts: Hahahahahahahaha
Finally Got My Shirts: Unlucky 
Finally Got My Shirts: I'll mute you @Supreme Chancellor 
Finally Got My Shirts: Nerd
Finally Got My Shirts: Gandhi is literally programmed as the least aggressive leader in the game you are unlucky as heck lol
Is it lent yet: France is taking over Dido
Is it lent yet: Oof
Finally Got My Shirts: Napoleon just wants his culture
Finally Got My Shirts: It could be worse. You could have Alexander, the most annoying opponent to have in the game.

Is it lent yet: I was so close
Is it lent yet: Shouldn‚Äôt have proposed Catholicism as world religion
