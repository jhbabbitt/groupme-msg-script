Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: @Saint Dismas is the man That was the only song with any kind of originality and felt like it had character instead of trying to be Let It Go 2.0 bruh 
Saint Dismas is the man: They literally wrote the music intentionally to not sound like let it go
Saint Dismas is the man: Are you kidding me
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: You telling me Into the Unknown didn't sound like it was trying to be Let It Go 2.0?
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Lost in the Woods was the best part of that movie

Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: No u
This is the way: Got to get an early start making those memes
This is the way: FIGHT!!!!
Saint Dismas is the man: 1.) into the unknown is the headliner for sure, but it’s definitely written with Idena Mendzel’s voice in mind. Like, you can tell it’s written for her voice. Let it go was just a pop song shoved into a Disney movie.
Saint Dismas is the man: 2.) Show Yourself is the best track on the album with the the lullaby in the middle and the key changes and stuff
Saint Dismas is the man: 3.) all the stuff with the Vulie and Cantu’s and Aurora is SO GOOD
Saint Dismas is the man: GG no re
