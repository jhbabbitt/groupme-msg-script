Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: ...monke
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Mmm...monke
2004 Auburn Tigers: Go to mass @The Crimson Tide 
Sus: It frustrates me so much when young adults have no loyalty to a parish￼. Never single young adult event is not for you. Rrrrrrreeeeeee
Sus: EVER*
Sus: every** lol I will get there
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Did you try inviting those guys you were talking to
Sus: Yes 
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: What happened
Sus: Ryan (the main target also likes F1) was  like that sounds awesome but Will Braeuner invited me to play kickball on a team at St henery every Monday 
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Will has betrayed us
Sus: Jacob everytime the frat Catholics have a party 
2004 Auburn Tigers: Lol
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: We're gonna plug evening prayer at our small group this week @Sus 
Sus: Perfect and we still doing evening prayer tonight but I only expect our Immediate circle￼
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Nah let's invite all the other parishes amirite 
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: It's 2022 no one has a home parish anymore duh
Sus: Just one post to the big groupme and we could have 670 people show up man Fr Fye would be so proud of us with those numbers 
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: LOL
Sus: No no, we need to have a hyped up kick-off event with people from all different parishes have them sign up for small groups, and then randomly put people in small groups...what could go wrong 
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Oh no no
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Matthew is taking shots
2004 Auburn Tigers: Oof
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: I think the St. Ann young adult system is flawed but I think the failure of it comes from the amplification of those flaws through the young adult culture of Nashville
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: I think the married group works because we're all settled in and established at St. Ann and so we see each other outside of the small group. It might not be fair to put it entirely on the small group model.
Sus: For me, the biggest issue was not having a foundation for the small group. The people within the small group were random there wasn't that personal invite into the small group. Then with the co ed groups if your motivation was to find a spouse as soon as you figured out that wasn't going to happen, then you have no reason to go to small group. The small group model only works with an established community. But for sure it amplification of those flaws through the young adult culture of Nashville
Sus: And it is drama Monday I'm getting lunch with Sean today 
2004 Auburn Tigers: @Sus Whenever anyone says the words “small groups”
Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo: Lol
