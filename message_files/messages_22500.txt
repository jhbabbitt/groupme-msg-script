GroupMe: This is the way changed name to Chris can't read
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: As Br. Micah Mary, or as we knew him Peter Kim, would say: "It's troo"
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9-W2a7XLzY
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: All good meme chats eventually come back to Star Wars @1-0 Season War Damn Eagle lol
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Well boys
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: My little sis got accepted to Vanderbilt
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Yeeeeeeehaw
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: It’s a big, big yeet
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Biggest yeet
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: If y’all think about it, say a prayer that we can afford it and everything. It’s her dream school
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Will the GI stuff help?
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Yeah but it’s basically nothing. I think she’s got like, 3 or 4 months of benefits
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Hmmm
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Whatever I had left over
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: That I didn’t use
Chris can't read: Vandy didn't offer her any financial aid? 
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: She hasn’t heard from financial aid yet
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: All she knows is that she’s accepted
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Since she applied early decision, scholarships come a little later, not sure when
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: At least that’s the way I understand it
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Well good news is that with their endowment Vandy is a lot more willing to give out money 
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Especially compared to Belmont lol
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Belmont's like "Hmmm you don't tick any boxes for our diversity criterion. No money for you."
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Yeah, Katie applied as Hispanic so hopefully that flies
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Haha nice
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: I could’ve done the same
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Obviously
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Whoa no way
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Sí
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: See? Hispanic
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Mind=blown
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: EZ scholarships
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Hehehe
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Basically at this point if Vanderbilt gives her anything worthwhile, she’s locked into Vanderbilt, because since she applied early decision, it would take Vanderbilt giving her less than Auburn for her to be allowed to back out
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Is that how that works? I never understood early decision or any of that stuff.
1-0 Season War Damn Eagle: Yeah it’s more complicated than that but that’s her particular situation
Ben Is Taking All My Shirts: Shoot wait I dont think I told y'all what Miranda got me for my birthday
