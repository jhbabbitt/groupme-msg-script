#BEBETTER: I feel like no one ever talks about how to do confession a lot like it's taboo or something 
#BEBETTER: Every priest should just do confession like Fr. Neely lol
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Do you feel guilt if the priest gives you a penance that is “easy” or “short”?
#BEBETTER: Sometimes it feels disappointing 
#BEBETTER: I know it irked me a lot going from Fr. Fye's old penances to Fr. G's one Hail Mary one Our Father
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Hmmm
Lowe’s Hater: @#BEBETTER Just really wants to travel to holy land as his penance 
#BEBETTER: Lol
#BEBETTER: Give me my sackcloth Father
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: I have thoughts and I keep halfway typing them out and then deleting them
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Phrasing phrasing
#BEBETTER: Same LOL
#BEBETTER: Stupid wordses
#BEBETTER: We hates them 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Father shouldn’t give you a sackcloth, you should be taking it off upon leaving confession
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Do you think there’s a clash between justice and mercy within yourself?
#BEBETTER: Prolly
#BEBETTER: Also I'm saving this one 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Talk to Fr Fye
