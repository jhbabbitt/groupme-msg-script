Salty Single Crisp X: Have you ever heard the tragedy of Pope Pius X ? I thought not It‚Äôs not a story the modernist Catholics will tell you. It is a trad legend. Pope Pius X was an old pope. So pious and so traditionalist that he could use his abilities to create.... saints. He had such knowledge of Catholic tradition that he could even save people from   heresy. He became so traditionalist‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Vatican II killed him in his sleep. Ironic. Is it possible to learn this power? Not from the Novus Ordo.
