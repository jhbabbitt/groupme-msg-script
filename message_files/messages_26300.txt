Great Prophet of Boss Nass: What I remember about the FSSP high mass was... was how reverent it was. During the waning hours of the 20th century, the young Catholics were discreetly transferred back into traditions of the church. It was a silent trip. We all knew what was about to happen. What the priest was about to do. Did we have any doubts? Any irreverent, charismatic thoughts? Perhaps but no one sang any praise and worship. Not on the drive to the church, not in line for confession, and not when the priest, deacon, and subdeacon processed into the church. Not a single drumbeat.
