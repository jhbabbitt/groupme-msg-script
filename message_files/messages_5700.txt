The Crimson Tide: I guess it depends on Publix 
2004 Auburn Tigers: Yeah I‚Äôm working Saturday 5-2
The Crimson Tide: null
2004 Auburn Tigers: Argentina and Honduras play Friday night still, I‚Äôd have to check if it‚Äôs televised if y‚Äôall still wanted to do soccer
The Crimson Tide: Ayyyyy
2004 Auburn Tigers: It‚Äôs probably going to be a blowout but whatever
The Crimson Tide: I'll buy my Japan jersey and cheer for Japan the whole time
2004 Auburn Tigers: You do that
The Crimson Tide: Thanks coach
2004 Auburn Tigers: They‚Äôve got Colombia in another friendly on Tuesday morning the 27th
Sus: Can‚Äôt buy Dutch jersey sadge
2004 Auburn Tigers: You can, you would just be considered a disgrace
The Crimson Tide: Lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: @The Crimson Tide @Sus we could also watch Rogue One on Friday night since Andor is coming out and we never did get around to watching it
Sus: I‚Äôm down 
Sus: null
The Crimson Tide: Pog
2004 Auburn Tigers: ‚ÄúMight get some traction‚Äù
2004 Auburn Tigers: Lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: @Ashley
Sus: Ashley seeing the McDevitt last name 
2004 Auburn Tigers: Ashley, go to the church calendar, wipe out any events that are scheduled for Monday evenings
2004 Auburn Tigers: Fr Fye: ‚ÄúSomeone get this man a key to St Ann‚Äôs‚Äù
Sus: Time to write another email 
The Crimson Tide: Oh my word
The Crimson Tide: It's supposed to be lowkey
The Crimson Tide: Grassroots
Sus: null
The Crimson Tide: Uh oh
2004 Auburn Tigers: No Ashley No
2004 Auburn Tigers: This is so not right
The Crimson Tide: null
2004 Auburn Tigers: When Ashley doesn‚Äôt know about our relationship with Fr Fye
2004 Auburn Tigers: @Sus Your response needs to include how we are mirroring our previous BCC event
2004 Auburn Tigers: And we thought Joniak was our biggest threat
2004 Auburn Tigers: A wild Ashley appeared!
The Crimson Tide: This is what is was like with planning my wedding
The Crimson Tide: She just overcomplicated everything
The Crimson Tide: And then we had to pay her for overcomplicating when we didn't want her as a wedding coordinator anyway
The Crimson Tide: (But it's required by St Ann)
2004 Auburn Tigers: Oof
2004 Auburn Tigers: I also think it‚Äôs a politically good move to emphasize that it‚Äôs less work for them than it could seem. Right now Ashley thinks she has to do all this promotion and reservations and scheduling and stuff, but in reality she doesn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre doing all the work here, we just need a space when it‚Äôs raining/cold
The Crimson Tide: Agreed
2004 Auburn Tigers: Also, invoking Fr Fye‚Äôs idea of community is going to ultimately win this battle
2004 Auburn Tigers: I wonder if Ashley knows what Vespers is
The Crimson Tide: OOF
The Crimson Tide: We should all be in on this email reply
The Crimson Tide: As in help compose don't copy me please I can't take it
Sus: do you guys want me to send you my draft repy or just copy it here
The Crimson Tide: Whatever works
Sus: sent
Sus: let me know if I need to add/change anything
Sus: Master McDevitt, what about time to promote and announce and a dinner location for dinner and vespers. What are we going to do? 

The Crimson Tide: I think it's good. I defer to Jacob.
Sus: Well jacob is going to see for a while so if you think its good I should send it
Sus: isnt
The Crimson Tide: null
Sus: null
Sus: Ashley just thinking im some young adult normie

The Crimson Tide: Hahahahahaha 
The Crimson Tide: McDevitt v McDevitt
The Crimson Tide: The battle for control of St. Ann
Sus: null
The Crimson Tide: Ded
The Crimson Tide: The McDevitts are taking over!
Sus: Hey Ashley,
That's not a problem at all we can start on October 3rd. I know that altar server training is once a month whenever this is a conflict, we can always pray vespers outside in one of the courtyards if the weather isn't too bad. But on the rare occasion that the weather is bad and there is altar server training, I can coordinate with my dad on where we can say vespers without disturbing altar server training. 
 In Christ,Matthew McDevitt
The Crimson Tide: LOL
The Crimson Tide: The way you hold it until the very end
The Crimson Tide: Ded
Sus: Oh and I learned that my Mom and my dad both have keys to st Ann‚Äôs

The Crimson Tide: Highly coordinated attack
The Crimson Tide: Coup d'√©tat

2004 Auburn Tigers: Guys we can‚Äôt start next week we have Ross Hashanah
Sus: ded

2004 Auburn Tigers: Rosh*
The Crimson Tide: üôÑ
Sus: well "officially" we are starting on October 3
The Crimson Tide: I guess this is Jacob's new shtick 
The Crimson Tide: Officially, there never was a vespers and dinner at St. Ann on September 26.
2004 Auburn Tigers: What do you mean we can‚Äôt start then we have big plans for Jewish New Year
2004 Auburn Tigers: We can invite the rando who draws stars of David in the prayer request book in the chapel
