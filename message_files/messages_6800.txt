Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: @Lowe’s Hater Was it full bible study mode Joseph?
#BEBETTER: Start from when you disengaged turbo mode and pulled up to the party
Lowe’s Hater: I talked to Erin who forgot I was at the UCAT party, I hung out with Joseph and Lindsey they seemed to be doing well then talked to some people who you guys don't know and met some new people. Drank some wine and tried my best to avoid talking politics with the conservative. I swear Joseph tries to out me for my politics at every party. I think that’s it for the most part. 
#BEBETTER: Hmmmm...
Lowe’s Hater: Any questions? 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Hmmm rare troll Joseph
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Lol

#BEBETTER: Finally finished my Santo Domingo de Silos chant album collection
#BEBETTER: Idk if this is just because of the way I do confession or the priest but I keep getting into the situation where I'm trying to confess some sins first that relate to the larger things I also want to confess, and the priest just jumps in at my first natural stopping point
#BEBETTER: Has that ever happened to y'all 
#BEBETTER: I have to be like "sorry Father, can you hold off on absolution I have some more things to confess"
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Giving you the Fr Neely treatment
#BEBETTER: But it's not like he wants to get me in and out because he'll stop me then give me a long string of advice on the things I've said 
#BEBETTER: But I'm like "this wasn't what I needed advice on Father I haven't finished yet:
#BEBETTER: Idk I'm just wondering if I should restructure my confession lol
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: That doesn’t really happen to me but it also doesn’t sound like a big deal
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: In my opinion
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Could be that you’re going into too much detail. Like, it seems like you’re asking for counsel instead of just saying the sin and frequency
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Seems like you’re asking for counsel to the priest*
#BEBETTER: Yeah I guess
#BEBETTER: I probably just give too much context
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: That seems like something you would do lol just a guess though and I don’t think it’s a big deal
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: If I ever want counsel on a specific thing, I say that at the beginning. Literally after the bless me father I say “father I am looking for advice/counsel regarding a specific sin that I will mention at the end” and then I get the other things, no matter the level of relative severity out of the way first, say the thing I’m looking for advice on, and then he can respond
#BEBETTER: I think maybe I just have an issue with comparing my penances with my sins and built this mechanism of overtextualizing my sins in the hope of getting a penance that feels like its justified
#BEBETTER: Would that count as scrupulosity
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: I’m not sure that’s a question I can answer for you
#BEBETTER: Maybe I'll ask Father Fye about it
