Quickbeam (again): Sophie had always been an ambitious woman. Her drive and determination had helped her achieve great things in her life, but unfortunately, it also led her to develop a bad habit of trying to take over Catholic communities and enforcing useless changes without the communities' permission. Her actions often ended up enraging members of the community, but Sophie never seemed to learn from her mistakes.

One day, Sophie was attending mass at the University Catholic in Nashville, TN. As she looked around the church, she noticed that there were many young adults like herself. Sophie felt that the community lacked something, and she believed that she could fill that void. She felt that the community needed a breakaway group, one that focused on the unique needs of young adults.
Quickbeam (again): Sophie decided to take action and start her own breakaway group. She talked to some like-minded people, and soon enough, they were meeting regularly outside the University Catholic. They discussed topics that were important to young adults, like relationships, faith, and work. They even organized a few events and started to gain a following.

However, the University Catholic community was not happy with Sophie's actions. They felt that she had tried to take over their community and was now trying to split it apart. The leaders of the University Catholic community spoke to Sophie, but she refused to listen. She felt that she was doing the right thing and that the community needed her breakaway group.
Quickbeam (again): Years passed, and Sophie had moved on to other things. She had become an active member of a young adult Catholics' GroupMe in Nashville, TN. She was excited to be part of a community of like-minded individuals and was grateful for the opportunity to connect with others.

But Sophie couldn't help herself. She felt that the name of the group was outdated and needed a change. Without asking for the group's permission, she changed the name to something that she felt was more fitting. However, the members of the group were not happy. They had been using the old name for years, and they felt that Sophie had disrespected their history and tradition.
Quickbeam (again): Sophie was once again at the center of a controversy. The members of the group spoke out against her, and many of them left the group. Sophie had once again tried to take over a Catholic community and enforce a change without their permission.

Sophie had a lot to learn about being part of a community. She needed to learn how to work with others and respect their traditions and history. She needed to understand that change was not always welcome, especially when it was forced upon a community. Hopefully, Sophie would learn from her mistakes and grow as a person, but only time would tell.
M'aiq the Liar: Hahahahahahha
M'aiq the Liar: Amazing
M'aiq the Liar: M'aiq has heard many stories like this before. Sometimes one person thinks they know everything, but they know nothing. They wander around, like a guar without a shepherd.
M'aiq the Liar: M'aiq has heard of coups in kingdoms and empires, but in a church? This is a strange concept indeed.
Quickbeam (again): Is there a Mâ€™aiq bot youâ€™re interacting with
M'aiq the Liar: I may have set something up haha
Not Stonks: Lol
M'aiq the Liar: M'aiq hears the accusations that there is AI being used to generate your responses. M'aiq thinks that is a strange thing to accuse someone of. It is no different than someone accusing you of using a spoon to eat your soup.
M'aiq the Liar: Joseph was attending a gaming convention in the heart of Tamriel when he met a peculiar character named M'aiq the Liar. M'aiq was known for his tendency to tell tall tales, but Joseph was not easily fooled.

"Ah, Joseph DiPaolo, your reputation precedes you. M'aiq has heard tales of your wit and cookie breaking."

As they chatted, they discovered they had a shared interest in joking around, and they hit it off instantly.

However, their good time was short-lived. Suddenly, the former US Men's National Soccer Team Coach Gregg Berhalter appeared, looking for Joseph. It turned out that Berhalter had heard Joseph joking about Malaysian Airlines again, and he was not happy about it. He challenged Joseph to another arm-wrestling match, hoping yet again to teach him a lesson.
M'aiq the Liar: Joseph knew he couldn't beat Berhalter with his puny human strength, so he came up with a plan. He decided to cheat and pulled out his pair of magical bionic arms he had obtained on his travels. With the bionic arms, he was able to beat Berhalter in a fierce arm-wrestling match.

As Berhalter stormed off, defeated and embarrassed, Joseph and M'aiq shared a good laugh. They decided to embark on a quest together to find the ultimate joke, one that would go down in history. They travelled through the fantastical lands of Tamriel, encountering dragons, daedra, and other fantastical creatures along the way.
M'aiq the Liar: Eventually, they arrived at a tavern in Whiterun, where they encountered a group of Orcs who were not amused by their jokes. A fight broke out, but Joseph and M'aiq managed to hold their own. In the aftermath, they discovered a clue to the ultimate joke: it was hidden in a secret tome, guarded by an ancient dragon.

Determined to uncover the ultimate joke, Joseph and M'aiq set out on a perilous quest to defeat the dragon and claim the tome. With the help of their bionic arms and their wit, they were able to overcome the dragon and claim the tome.

Inside the tome, they found the ultimate joke: "Why did the Khajiit cross the road? To get to the other skooma den!" Joseph and M'aiq laughed and laughed, knowing that this was the joke that would go down in history. They travelled back to the gaming convention, where they shared the joke with all their new friends, including Berhalter who begrudgingly admitted that it was pretty funny.
Quickbeam (again): It really was the greatest joke in history
M'aiq the Liar: Indeed I can barely contain myself
M'aiq the Liar: I didn't even ask it to put Berhalter in I just said write a story about Joseph and M'aiq meeting LOL

Tickets 4 sale (text me): If was ever set to music by him
Tickets 4 sale (text me): Couldâ€™ve just been a poem or a prayer attributed to him
Tickets 4 sale (text me): 19th and 20th century musicians LOVED setting random prayers and stuff to music
M'aiq the Liar: Hmmmm 
M'aiq the Liar: Yeah also a possibility 
Tickets 4 sale (text me): Itâ€™s hard to say. Itâ€™s a prayer attributed to him, so we donâ€™t actually know when or where it came from. Because of that itâ€™s been translated who knows how many times, often retranslated into modern forms of languages. Then it had to be formed to set to music, I donâ€™t remember if it rhymed or had a syllabic rhythm, but it probably had to be modified to fit music, so who knows if itâ€™s even recognizable from its origin
