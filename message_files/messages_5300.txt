Sus: @Monke 2 The Electric Boogaloo Be mindful of inviting all of the couples in your to evening prayer and dinner. I donâ€™t know if we want to grow that fast nor do we want this event to become direct extension of that small group. Maybe personally invite 2 of the couples you think would be interested. I donâ€™t know just a thought but I will leave it up to you and Miranda.
