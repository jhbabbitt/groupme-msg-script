Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Matthew is in full turncoat mode today
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Betrayed not once but twice
One Habakkuk boi: After 35 games, the Swiss Guard have really hit their stride, and currently sit at 23-12
One Habakkuk boi: Their record is the best in the league, but the sawteeth sit only one game behind at 22-12
One Habakkuk boi: Christopher Castel has maintained his form, currently batting .477 with 11 HRs and 28 RBI
One Habakkuk boi: His average is still the second best in the league
One Habakkuk boi: His 11 home runs are the most in the league
One Habakkuk boi: Matthew McDoIt has maintained his form, in the sense that he continues to injure himself after every game he plays in
One Habakkuk boi: Heâ€™s batting .245 with 3 homers and 19 RBIs
One Habakkuk boi: With only 15 games left in the regular season, the Swiss Guard look poised to make a run deep into the playoffs, and a championship matchup between the Swiss Guard and either the Sawteeth or Moonstars looks inevitable
