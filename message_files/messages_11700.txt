Berry Hill PD: Right now I can do any other day, I think
Berry Hill PD: Well, actually Thursdays aren’t great either because I have soccer
Tech: null
Berry Hill PD: Going or nah
Tech: I don’t know Thursday is really far away I have no idea what I have planned I will get back to you. 
Berry Hill PD: Oof
Berry Hill PD: Big oof
Berry Hill PD: Don’t say that
Tattletale: Yeah better to just not respond 
Tech: null
Tech: Jk
Berry Hill PD: You should go though if you want
Berry Hill PD: IMO
Tattletale: @Tech can you see about getting that ladder
Tech: What ladder? My parents ladder?
Tattletale: Whichever one you said we could get to clean the gutter
Tech: Lol no one here thinks I should got to game night 
Tech: Go*
Tattletale: Yeah I would say no too
Tech: Basically, Joseph said that I should draw the line. This is basically an olive branch from Katie and I should reject it.  
Tech: But going to this party would be the easy thing to do. But might not be the right thing in the long term. 
Berry Hill PD: Hmm
Tattletale: I'm with Joseph for once 
Tattletale: Though I wouldn't call it an "olive branch" that's dramatic
Tech: I don't know know what else to call it 
Tech: But I should reply by tonight with Bible study tomorrow 
Tattletale: There's no law saying you have to reply 
Tattletale: You can say it tomorrow
Tech: Well if I wait until tomorrow I basically will do it in person 
Tech: Should I just go with the: Thanks for the offer but I won't be able to come.
Tattletale: I think Lord of the Wings has been decided for us
Berry Hill PD: Whoever’s Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 is in the shower, I’ve definitely been accidentally using it the past couple days and that’s why you’re out. I can get you more at Publix tomorrow if you so desire
Berry Hill PD: Lmk
Berry Hill PD: Meme it up boys
Berry Hill PD: Haven’t spoken to this girl since Projects 2018
Tech: null
Berry Hill PD: Literally
Berry Hill PD: Me right now
Tech: When you don't reply 
Berry Hill PD: Idk what she’s talking about song recommendations
Berry Hill PD: Maybe I showed her some classical music or something
Tattletale: Send her Haken
Tattletale: Haken Haken Haken
Tech: You should act like your music taste have changed and send her a playlist of dubstep or something 
Berry Hill PD: I like how you both very similar ideas
Berry Hill PD: “Send her dubstep”
Tattletale: There's a Haken song with a dubstep breakdown
Tattletale: Best of both worlds
Berry Hill PD: “Send her Prague metal”
Berry Hill PD: Wait
Berry Hill PD: Prague or Prog
Berry Hill PD: @Tattletale 
Tattletale: Prog
Tattletale: Like progressive 
Berry Hill PD: Idk why I instinctively typed Prague
Berry Hill PD: I knew it was prog
Tech: Proggers dude
Tattletale: Because our third roommate loves Europe he's taking over
Berry Hill PD: LOL
Tattletale: LOL
Tattletale: I am 100% using that line
Tattletale: I'm seeing Dream Theater in March and I will find the right moment
Tattletale: *Mental breakdown with 5 time signature changes*
Tattletale: "Proggers dude"

Tattletale: Btw I bought the potatoes for us to all share so if you want to cook with potatoes help yourself 
Tattletale: Most certainly @Tech the potato lover
Tech: YEET 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
Tattletale: Also @Berry Hill PD that number was not accurate the current tally is 4 not counting the tiny roach I watched die in the basement from the poison
Tattletale: "GOOOOOOOD"
Tattletale: I could hear that over my Prague metal
Tattletale: TBD on the Dublin metal
Berry Hill PD: @Tattletale Stop coughing

Berry Hill PD: We love it when no manager shows up to open the gate so you sit in your car for an hour and will most likely have to stay late
Berry Hill PD: Like, we open in 30 minutes and the employees can’t even get in
Berry Hill PD: At what point do I leave
Berry Hill PD: Update we got in at 7:05 very cool
Tattletale: OOF
Tattletale: Seize the means of production Jacob
Tech: Honestly my 2 cents I think you should leave Publix they aren’t paying you enough to wake up at 4:30 am and deal with bad management. I think in the current labor market conditions it would be easy to find a job in the service Industry that pays more and doesn’t have such brutal hours. ￼
Tattletale: Ahhhhhh yeah
Tech: So would everyone be down for some Baja for dinner tomorrow? 
Tattletale: null
Tattletale: Best reddit bot I have ever seen 
Tattletale: What time for Baja @Tech 
Tech: 6:00? 
Tattletale: I won't be in Nashville until like 6:45
Tattletale: I can go straight to Baja but 645 is probably my earliest
Tech: ￼ok 6:45 lol 
Tattletale: YEET
Tattletale: null
Tattletale: They're really trying to get people to come to Burger King @Tech lol
Tech: Oh no 
Tattletale: Change of plans we're going to Burger King lol
Tech: NOPE
Tattletale: Hahaha
Tech: We are at Baja
Tattletale: What a coincidence 
Tattletale: I am also at Baja
