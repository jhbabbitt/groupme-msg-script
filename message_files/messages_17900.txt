Strider: @Tera Sinube I heard a nasty rumor that you have started playing Dota 
Tera Sinube: Yeah I’m liking it a lot more than I thought I would so far
Strider: null
Tera Sinube: Why?
Tera Sinube: @Strider 
Strider: I've just heard that game is so toxic it's not also just not my type of game. But it's good that you are having fun with it 
Tera Sinube: It’s incredibly toxic
Tera Sinube: If you’re playing with randoms 
Tera Sinube: Which I don’t plan on doing anytime soon
I Miscalculated: Perfect I'm in now
I Miscalculated: Let's play random Jacob
Tera Sinube: Noooooo
Tera Sinube: Casual isn’t bad
Tera Sinube: Definitely not your type of game @Strider lol
Tera Sinube: Really I’m learning it just because I’ve never played anything like it before and I want to appreciate it
Strider: Yeah I assumed it wasn't my game 
Strider: I ordered the case for the new PC 
Strider: null
Tera Sinube: @Strider I mean, if you want to try it it’s free, and you might like it but I doubt it
Tera Sinube: It’s a lot of strategy, micromanaging, communication, and teamwork
Tera Sinube: But there are good meme characters
Tera Sinube: Also the International is probably the coolest esports tournament

Tera Sinube: Work until 9:30
Tera Sinube: Might get out early but no promises
I Miscalculated: @Strider 
Strider: Lol
Strider: A little trivia after Steven Spielberg screened Schindler's List (1993) for John Williams to compose the score, Williams was so moved he had to walk outside for several minutes. Upon returning, Williams said that the movie needed a better composer than him to which Spielberg replied: "I know, but they're all dead."
