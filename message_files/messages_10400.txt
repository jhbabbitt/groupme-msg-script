The Memeless One: Y'all need to figure it out quick because they require 60 days written notice to terminate the lease and get your security deposit back
The Memeless One: (I read that in the lease agreement teehee)
The Memeless One: Though if they're willing to have it I would stay an extra month so I wouldn't have to get a new place and live by myself for a month
The Memeless One: If y'all would be interested in asking if we can extend to May at the least I'll email back
chaos elmo: Really the main thing for me is that do I need to start hunting for a new place or a new roommate or both? 
The Memeless One: I mean that's really not something I can answer. Y'all know my plans and my way forward is pretty clear so I say let's address May first and then we can all figure out our next steps from there once we know what May looks like.
