One Speechy Boi: He straight-up told Heather Daugherty that not being able to have candles for Mass was "unacceptable" Saturday 
I miss the Salve Regina: Heck
One Speechy Boi: Also why does she always come to Move-In Mass and say the responses we changed like 10 freaking years ago
I miss the Salve Regina: Say a prayer for me, in a bit I’m going to a party at the men’s missionary house. Parties like this are one of my worst social nightmares but at the same time I kinda need this community. I know it sounds stupid but pray that I’m able to explain my situation with patience and that I have a good time
Darth Burrito: @One Speechy Boi  Where you at 
One Speechy Boi: In class u dingus
One Speechy Boi: Where there's just a casual member of the Walt Disney Company teaching and telling us that as part of class we're designing attractions to suggest to Disney Imagineering

One Speechy Boi: I think it's a good meme
I miss the Salve Regina: Wow
I miss the Salve Regina: Should’ve picked Pocatello
One Speechy Boi: You'd like that huh
I miss the Salve Regina: Yeeeeeeeees
One Speechy Boi: Big yeet
I miss the Salve Regina: So I discovered this afternoon that my pastor taught Father Fye in seminary
I miss the Salve Regina: He said he thought it was funny because Father Fye wrote on the moral implications of marijuana use but at the same time he seemed like he could’ve been a pothead lolol 
One Speechy Boi: So my new roommate
One Speechy Boi: Is Catholic
One Speechy Boi: And he's apparently just casually a fourth degree Knight of Columbus
I miss the Salve Regina: Heck
One Speechy Boi: I got him to come to game night. I'm gonna give him a maneuver I like to call "The Zach Janson".
I miss the Salve Regina: Lol
I miss the Salve Regina: Speaking of Zach I met one of his good friends at Summer Projects
I miss the Salve Regina: From high school or something. I think their families are good friends
One Speechy Boi: I miss Zach
One Speechy Boi: Life feels so much duller without his commentary tbh
I miss the Salve Regina: How was game night @One Speechy Boi 
One Speechy Boi: We didn't have a ton of freshmen but I think it definitely solidified the community more
One Speechy Boi: And Quinn is still killing it
One Speechy Boi: Like he's the best thing that has happened for Belmont in terms of reaching out to people on the fringes
I miss the Salve Regina: Dang that’s great
I miss the Salve Regina: How’s Geoly doing
I miss the Salve Regina: He seems to be taking responsibility in the GroupMe
One Speechy Boi: He's actually doing incredible he's stepping up so much
One Speechy Boi: Quinn has beelined for him
I miss the Salve Regina: Lol
One Speechy Boi: Nigel definitely grew as well. We've got some weak points still but he's doing great.
One Speechy Boi: (It's probably because he got away from P-E-M-B-R-O-K-E)
I miss the Salve Regina: God bless
