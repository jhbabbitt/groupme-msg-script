Darth Burrito: null
Darth Chinese New Year: Ok @Darth Pizza Time I see the strength of the Shoshone now
Darth Pizza Time: Now? lol
Darth Chinese New Year: I'm playing as them
Darth Pizza Time: Mhmmm
Darth Chinese New Year: These Pathfinders are hacking good
Darth Pizza Time: Yep
Darth Chinese New Year: And an extra tile for a city? 
Darth Pizza Time: Defense bonus as well
Darth Pizza Time: Everything that tries to attack you just dies
Darth Pizza Time: Comanche riders are okay. Pretty bad compared to other mounted units but still a welcome bonus
Darth Pizza Time: Specialized mounted units
Darth Chinese New Year: Also you get to CHOOSE the ancient ruin bonus?
Darth Pizza Time: Yes sir
Darth Chinese New Year: Heck you get the Shoshone rolling you're not getting stopped
Darth Chinese New Year: I also got freaking sailing on turn 2 in this game lol
Darth Pizza Time: Personally I think they’re fun because they’re good, but not overpowered. They are flexible in which victory they can go for, and they make the early game fun/interesting
Darth Chinese New Year: I think they're pretty OP against the unprepared
Darth Chinese New Year: i.e. Consul ChesterKiwi of Mongolia 
Darth Pizza Time: Lol
Darth Pizza Time: But if someone is prepared and can stop the Shoshone from getting on that roll, they’re super easy to defeat
Darth Pizza Time: Hey say a prayer for me, Nick, Katie Gillett, and a few others. We’re climbing Long’s peak tomorrow morning
Darth Burrito: How was the hike did you get lost 
Darth Pizza Time: We made it
Darth Pizza Time: 3/5 of us summited
