Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Also I asked about Rachel and he said "She is insane"
One Habakkuk boi: I shouldnâ€™t be bashing Pete. Iâ€™m sorry
One Habakkuk boi: I apologize. I know all this isnâ€™t easy for him
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: So mean to my boy 
One Habakkuk boi: I sAiD I WAs sORrY
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Also apparently JEREMY is the reason he's not coming to B stud
One Python Boi: At least he didnâ€™t tell me that he was going to marry this girl 
One Python Boi: He also doesnâ€™t want to be on board 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Lol
One Habakkuk boi: null
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I'm pretty sure they're gonna ask Sofia, Miranda, Camden, Ben, and him
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I think Ben as president would be a good meme
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: As much as I appreciate Sofia I'm not sure she has the skillset or capacity for president either
One Python Boi: Iâ€™d be down for Ben being president 
One Habakkuk boi: Yâ€™all better hurry up and convert Todd Lake because this new board is going to need all the help they can get
One Habakkuk boi: Guys who even needs a board
One Habakkuk boi: I say we get rid of the board entirely
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: As long as Lauren isn't on it tbh
One Habakkuk boi: Jesus Christ is sufficient enough, am I right?
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I'm pretty sure Fr. G does not like Lauren now
One Habakkuk boi: The Bible says nothing about boards. That means they are unnecessary
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Stahp that
One Habakkuk boi: Of course you would want to keep the board, youâ€™re on the board
One Habakkuk boi: Politicians will do anything to retain their office
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Palpatine didn't want to keep the Senate
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: He just became the Senate 
One Habakkuk boi: I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new board-less BCC
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Go do something with your mascot-confused football team

One Python Boi: Also Josephâ€™s party was a little too lit last night and got a visit from the fire department.  
One Habakkuk boi: LOL WHAT
One Python Boi: Itâ€™s kinda hard to explain 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Wait WHAT
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Explain now
One Python Boi: I also did a jello shot with Joseph 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Did y'all break fire codes? Was there an actual fire?
One Habakkuk boi: Sheesh
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I need answers
One Habakkuk boi: @Wii Sports Baseball Legend Youâ€™re not allowed to ask for the quiet game and then demand answers
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Too bad I just did
One Python Boi: Mmmm well Joseph being Joseph had to go full out. Joseph promoted the party at one Spanish speaking church. A group from that church offered to preform for the party. For the performance they used incense that triggered the fire alarm. 
One Habakkuk boi: Lolololol
One Python Boi: This was about midway through the party 
One Habakkuk boi: Thatâ€™s freaking hilarious
One Python Boi: It's a good meme 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I'm def
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Ded* YIKES

One Python Boi: I need a good app name for my backend capstone thats a college budget app
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Oh boy I was just thinking of an app I wanted you to make

One Python Boi: to be honest your my inspiration for the app @Wii Sports Baseball Legend 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Awww yeet
One Python Boi: @Wii Sports Baseball Legend let me know if thier are any features that you want
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: A wages calculator
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: Punch in on the app when you get in, punch out and it tells you your hours and earnings
One Python Boi: interesting basisly a time tracker
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: But also it calculates monies
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: (I also need this because the Sodexo time clock has not been working)
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: All the apps out there drain my battery because for some ludicrous reason they want to run in the background
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: I also met Pete's lady today 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: When Margaret Gupton copied my entire email from last Awakening for prep 
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: NO ORIGINALITY 
One Python Boi: Lol my staff emails get copied 
One Python Boi: Whoever is doing the staff emails better have some dank memes
One Python Boi: Man got away with so much with my emails
One Habakkuk boi: I talked to Jimmy Mitchell today
One Habakkuk boi: And I think Iâ€™m going to apply for the apprenticeship program
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: HECK
Wii Sports Baseball Legend: HECKHECKHECK
