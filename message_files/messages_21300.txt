Yah-eet!: Alright lads, I’m coming up Friday, not sure what time yet, but I won’t be later than 5:30, and I’m leaving Saturday evening 
Yah-eet!: I would prefer if you kept this on the DL, as I want this to be about Jeremy and not about me visiting

Supreme Chancellor: 
@GONK 
Yah-eet!: Lol

Yah-eet!: Nick Selser tried to explain the meme to Brittany and Cheyenne (from Projects) when we met up in Birmingham and they didn’t buy it
Supreme Chancellor: 
? What meme 
Yah-eet!: The Jacob gets all the women meme
Yah-eet!: Speaking of women though, while we’re on the subject, please continue to pray for my vocation. Like I said a few weeks ago, discernment is a real struggle. Been feeling very lonely lately and with that comes that inherent desire for a relationship. Same sort of feeling you and I had last spring @Supreme Chancellor. Luckily I’m not in a position to do anything about it, but if it continues I’m only going to continue struggling.
Yah-eet!: But just because I’m not in a position to do anything about it doesn’t mean I won’t make bad decisions based on that feeling. There’s already been a few moments that I’ve had to catch myself
Yah-eet!: Boys. Is this what I think it means????
Supreme Chancellor: Oh no 
Supreme Chancellor: null
Yah-eet!: @Supreme Chancellor I will surpass you as meme master
Supreme Chancellor: You could never do that 
Yah-eet!: null
GONK: null
GONK: I am the meme master
GONK: null
GONK: Spicy one
GONK: Today I realized that this guy's name, Ima-Gun Di, is a joke on "I'm gonna die" because he's shot dead by droids at the end of the episode. Cheeky.

GONK: Y'all suck I can't tell which is which anymore
Yah-eet!: You didn’t know that @GONK?
GONK: About Di?
GONK: I never thought about it until today
Yah-eet!: Yeah lol
Supreme Chancellor: RIP
GONK: Nope.gif
