One Sid Meier boi: @One Python Boi I'm so much better at mastering RTS games than FPS ones
One Python Boi: you can do it
One Habakkuk boi: @One Sid Meier boi I think if you really liked it though, you’d be decent at it
One Habakkuk boi: Like, CS is super deep in its gameplay. Very different from most FPSs. CS is like 50% aim/mechanics and 50% game sense, map knowledge, and strategy.
One Habakkuk boi: It’s not like CoD or TF2 or Halo where it’s literally just whoever can clock heads better wins
One Habakkuk boi: Click*
One Habakkuk boi: For example, once you learn how flashbangs work, the game completely changes. And that’s just flashbangs, let alone smokes, frat grenades, and Molotov’s
