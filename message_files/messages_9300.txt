Lord chaos elmo: Well we look forward to your return tomorrow 
Sneaky Babbittses: Agreed. Shooting for 5 PM but will definitely be back in time for Exodus meeting
Sneaky Babbittses: I will tell you now that from my perspective, she as a person fits the bill, spiritually, personality, everything makes sense in that regard. It’s just am I/we called into this, and if so what does that look like
Sneaky Babbittses: At least from my point of view
Sneaky Babbittses: The biggest news is that she’s confirmed staying in Marquette this next year
Lord chaos elmo: So she is staying in Canada 
Sneaky Babbittses: Yes
Sneaky Babbittses: Which is good and bad. Good because we don’t have to play the political focus game of “move me somewhere closer”. Bad because well. It’s almost Canada

The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: Breaking news
The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: Bitcoin mogul thinks in economic terms
Sneaky Babbittses: Like, if this was happening in Nash and she lived in Nash, I would still want at least one more real date. Does that make sense?
