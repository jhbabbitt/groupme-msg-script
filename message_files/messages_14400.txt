hevydevyfan1997: Let's start putting our move in date as immediately 
Ymir da Tursk: I have a few hours before work I will compile a shortlist of places still available
hevydevyfan1997: That will give us an edge 
Ymir da Tursk: My shortlist is just an updated version of the same spreadsheet we have been using
Ymir da Tursk: Iâ€™d appreciate it if you guys went through it tonight and eliminate anything that is off the table that I mightâ€™ve somehow missed
Ymir da Tursk: Iâ€™ve also expanded our search region to include a little more of south Nashville as well, just to give us options
Ymir da Tursk: If thatâ€™s not okay, then you can take those off or put them on low priority
hevydevyfan1997: I'm just yeeting in applications
hevydevyfan1997: How do we feel about 2200/mo?
hevydevyfan1997: It comes out to roughly 730 per person at that point
hevydevyfan1997: It's a bit of a jump but we can decide if we get a bite
hevydevyfan1997: Ok so here's my math
hevydevyfan1997: I just got a pay raise at Chick-fil-A and am making 14/hr now
hevydevyfan1997: Factoring in breaks which take off 2.5 hours total from my wages as well as an assumed 10% in taxes
hevydevyfan1997: My monthly income
hevydevyfan1997: Seeeems to be able to support going a little higher
hevydevyfan1997: I ran the numbers and I come out to about 1890 while Jacob about 1755
hevydevyfan1997: per month
hevydevyfan1997: Food is the biggest factor. I get a bit of a break on that since I don't have to buy one meal a day 5 times a week. Now, if we were to communalize our food a little bit it would decrease our food budget on an individual basis.
Tidehunter: our food
hevydevyfan1997: Yes our house shall be a beacon of socialism
hevydevyfan1997: Isaac will love it
