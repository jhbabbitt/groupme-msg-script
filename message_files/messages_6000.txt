The Crimson Tide: We have Miranda on the inside already
Sus: This was always going to be the end game of the frat Catholics. These parties are no way to build community or even friendships. So if it doesn't do that then why do it at all?
The Crimson Tide: But muh booze
2004 Auburn Tigers: Begun, the Catholic frat parties war has
The Crimson Tide: Michael Morrow vs McCrucifer smackdown
The Crimson Tide: I want it now
Sus: Sure they attracted a ton of people but they will search and find nothing. And because there is no purpose behind the party they will just drink.
The Crimson Tide: Oof
The Crimson Tide: Matthew spitting ðŸ”¥ today 
2004 Auburn Tigers: You know itâ€™s real bad when Matthew is cracking down like this damn
The Crimson Tide: Gear up boys
The Crimson Tide: To war!
Sus: Its my experience I guess
The Crimson Tide: null
Sus: lol so many people are leaving the groupme
The Crimson Tide: Keep a tally for us
The Crimson Tide: \ o /
2004 Auburn Tigers: The triumvirate when there are nothing but bad events, people are angry, and chaos reigns supreme in a Catholic community somewhere in Tennessee
Sus: ded
Sus: Also, this group is a classic example of too much growth too fast. A GroupMe for everyone quickly becomes a GroupMe for no one
2004 Auburn Tigers: Someone call up Carly we need her to come out of retirement
2004 Auburn Tigers: Because this time, itâ€™s personal
2004 Auburn Tigers: xd 
Sus: null
Sus: there must be another groupme that has formed
Sus: 8 people have left
2004 Auburn Tigers: I think a good indicator is that even if I was super social and wanted to have good event ideas, I wouldnâ€™t post them in that groupme because it is just too big @Sus 
2004 Auburn Tigers: Ded 
Sus: yeah it's too big these events lose the intimacy that is required to invest in people
Sus: man I could write an essay on why this faith community model is doomed to fail
2004 Auburn Tigers: @Sus Is our next lighthouse speaker
Sus: lol it would be too spicy
Sus: null
The Crimson Tide: Isaac NO
The Crimson Tide: NO ISAAC
The Crimson Tide: That was so not right 
Sus: null
Sus: im proud of you @The Crimson Tide 
The Crimson Tide: Quote Miranda: "Isaac never participates until there's drama and then he comes in way too hard"
The Crimson Tide: I knew you'd like that lol @Sus 
The Crimson Tide: Why'd you cut out all the Jimmy Emmons tea tho Matthew Miranda was showing me it all
The Crimson Tide: Bro can't shut up about how he needs his beet
The Crimson Tide: Beer*
Sus: Isaac when groupme drama happens
The Crimson Tide: LOL
The Crimson Tide: So accurate 
Sus: I didnt mean to leave you out I just didnt get it all
The Crimson Tide: "Let me stir the pot up and reverse all the progress made in this conversation"
The Crimson Tide: The giant GroupMe is probably a factor is why the small groups are failing too tbh
The Crimson Tide: No one wants to be part of a single parish they just want to go to all the huge events with all the Nashville Catholics 
Sus: Then the question must be asked what is the motivation to go to these huge events? vs going to small group
The Crimson Tide: To get sLoShEd
The Crimson Tide: This is such an American church problem am I right @Sus 
Sus: Nah thats just a by-product
The Crimson Tide: Is it though?
Sus: you have been out of the game for to too long @The Crimson Tide 
The Crimson Tide: Whatchu mean
The Crimson Tide: Miranda agrees with us now we have true power
The Crimson Tide: Now we just need to have someone call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Joniak
The Crimson Tide: And then we take over
Sus: people are looking to date that is their main motivation when going to these events
The Crimson Tide: How about they just date Jesus
Sus: you can feel it when you go to these parties and it just feels wierd
Sus: I fear that for a lot of these people the vocation of marriage has almost become an idol in itself
The Crimson Tide: Damn
Sus: this is what my lighthouse talk would be about
The Crimson Tide: That would be the most fire lighthouse talk ever
The Crimson Tide: #realtalk
2004 Auburn Tigers: What an F tier comment by Isaac
2004 Auburn Tigers: Just find your vocation 4head
2004 Auburn Tigers: Thatâ€™s half of the problem
The Crimson Tide: Go ahead and make them all even more desperate good idea
2004 Auburn Tigers: I am mald
2004 Auburn Tigers: Geez
The Crimson Tide: Hahahaha
The Crimson Tide: This has been a spicy day indeex
Sus: it going to spicy tonight at the house
Sus: be*
2004 Auburn Tigers: Geez
2004 Auburn Tigers: Hmmm we need another treatise from @The Crimson Tide 
The Crimson Tide: Oh no
The Crimson Tide: Holy flashback
The Crimson Tide: 4 years ago
Sus: what I dont get is that sure you might meet a ton of people at this party but  thats not how you build a relationship especially a relationship for marriage
The Crimson Tide: Idk Miranda and I met at a rager called Awakening
2004 Auburn Tigers: Hmmm we need another treatise from @The Crimson Tide 
Sus: i can feel it
The Crimson Tide: Who needs to print enough pamphlets anyway when all of the Diocese is in one GroupMe
2004 Auburn Tigers: The whole diocese except any clergy
The Crimson Tide: OOF
The Crimson Tide: TRUUUUUUE DUDE
The Crimson Tide: Get Fr. Bulso in there
Sus: nah a ton of them are in the chat
Sus: I know Father Fye is in the group
Sus: Fr. Bulso is also in the group lol
The Crimson Tide: Hmmm
The Crimson Tide: "Let this chaos govern itself"
Sus: In order to ensure sainthood and continue a Christ centered communites, the frat Catholics will be reorganized into parish-based young adult communities, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
Sus: null
The Crimson Tide: Hahahahahaha
