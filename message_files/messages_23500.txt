I have spoken: Yeah but like
I have spoken: He could‚Äôve just asked for it back
I have spoken: HOW LONG IS THIS FIGHT SCENE
I have spoken: It‚Äôs going to take the whole dang episode
I have spoken: Also, doesnt the baby gave to eat or something?

I have spoken:  So I um
I have spoken: I got the new Star Wars game
sleepyboi: and?
sleepyboi: is it good
I have spoken: Certainly not bad
I have spoken: 6/10 so far
I have spoken: Probably not worth the price yet for me
I have spoken: But if you‚Äôre into the melee/parry/dodge sort of game it‚Äôs probably really good
I have spoken: It does feel authentically Star Wars though, at least for me. Some people say it doesn‚Äôt and I see that side as well
I have spoken: Force powers aren‚Äôt OP but at the same time they‚Äôre kind of... unique? Different? Inconsistent? Idk how to describe
I have spoken: Lightsaber customization is quite simple yet really fun
sleepyboi: Nice
sleepyboi: But we have to get that win in apex
I have spoken: Combat is actually pretty good, and this is my first game of this style
I have spoken: But it‚Äôs not intuitive for me so I‚Äôm struggling
I have spoken: But the swordplay is really satisfying
sleepyboi: Its just dark souls
I have spoken: Shut up matthew
I have spoken: Get outta here with your dark souls
Achievement Hunter Extraordinaire: Rekt
Achievement Hunter Extraordinaire: Meanwhile I'm out here playing a 21 year old game lol
I have spoken: So for this game, the order of progression of learning to use the force goes
1.) SLOW DOWN TIME
2.) use the force to run on the walls like you‚Äôre freaking lucio
And then AND ONLY AFTER YOU‚ÄôVE LEARNED THESE FIRST TO
3.) push things
Achievement Hunter Extraordinaire: Lol
I have spoken: I get that the first one is supposed to be more of a force ‚Äúsense‚Äù thing, but that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs used. You literally stop fast moving obstacles and stuff like that
I have spoken: Zach Janson at the Melchizedek project is a BIG BIG YEET
I have spoken: Also, are Will Braeuner and Margaret Gupton still a thing?
I have spoken: Because Will was there too so I‚Äôm guessing not
sleepyboi: Will and Margaret are no longer a thing and Will  is back on that priest  grind 
I have spoken: Oof 
I have spoken: I was rooting for them
sleepyboi: I'm glad they didn't start that podcast
I have spoken: They wanted to start a podcast?
