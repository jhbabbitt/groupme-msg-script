Wasabi Juan: Honestly it‚Äôs just a Ponzi schemeÔøº at this point 
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Oof
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: That's awky
Wasabi Juan: null
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: It looks like my spackle job did good enough to fool them about the damage to the wall lol
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: They'll never know how deep that hole is
Wasabi Juan: Baja tonight?
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Ehhhhh
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: I probably shouldn't for the sake of financial prudence 
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: I probably shouldn't for the sake of financial prudence 
Wasabi Juan: Last round of bill for auburn lane sorry I was late pay when ever 
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: "I've never been closer to popping off on Camden" - Miranda

Wasabi Juan: Know*
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Ded
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: That‚Äôs what Camden is going to be when Miranda gets through with her ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Ded
Wasabi Juan: Ded
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Confession today is with Fr. Brent Thayer 
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: POG POG POG
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: Camden is still at it
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: She refuses to agree with Miranda saying that it's not Joey telling everyone about the date and still won't respond to him
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: I'm about to lose my mind
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Ah yes
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: So now not only do we not have the maturity to go on a first date
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: But we also don‚Äôt have the maturity to not let a simple no create divides between us and our friends
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Very cool
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: null
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: I'm about ready to step in myself and I am past the point of playing coy because this crap is not coming to the wedding
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: #GoBackToOhio
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: OOF
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: Imagine Joey like, saying anything to anyone ever
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: I‚Äôve never heard that man speak in my life
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: And she‚Äôs accusing him of talking about the date and saying it was good? Like even if he did, is he not free to do so?
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: And even BEYOND that, the only reason he would EVER tell anyone it went well is because SHE HAS FAILED TO COMMUNICATE OTHERWISE
Wasabi Juan: @Camden 
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: No memes yet of Obi-Wan running away from Vader so this the next best depiction of Camden running away from responsibility and charity
Elvis‚Äôs Stump Leg: What makes this worse is that I‚Äôm also tempted to jump in, but if Camden catches wind she‚Äôs going to assume I‚Äôm mad because she‚Äôs saying no to Joey, and not mad about the way she‚Äôs going about it all
Brandon McMillan from Lucky Dog: It's so dumb
