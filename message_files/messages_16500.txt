No Notifications: @Earthshaker Kevin transferred in last year and lives with Ben and the missionaries 
No Notifications: I'm just glad Pete didnt get put on the board because he was literally bragging about how he was gonna get VP if he applied for it
No Notifications: Justice
No Notifications: I'm actually pretty satisfied with the Belmont board knowing those people. Not bad choices.
Ours: Miranda should of been president tbh. I know @No Notifications didnt want that and you know most of these people better then @Earthshaker and me. So I’m glad you think these are good choices. 
No Notifications: Miranda knew he would never pick her because he favors the more outgoing people
No Notifications: In the end she said it will probably be healthier for her to be just a pillar

Earthshaker: What’s y’all’s work situation for next week? I just got my schedule, and I have more days off in a row than I thought I did. Thinking about paying a visit, especially because my plans to come in January aren’t working out. @No Notifications Are you staying in Nashville Tuesday-Thursday? 
Earthshaker: Thinking about potentially Tuesday morning through either Wednesday night or Thursday morning
Earthshaker: Lmk y’all’s plans
Ours: So I have an early leave day on Wednesday and then I have Thursday and Friday off
No Notifications: I only have Thursday and my family will be in town and will probably want to spend all their time with me
No Notifications: They get here Monday
Earthshaker: Aight so probably not worth then

No Notifications: Not on my end at least
Earthshaker: Aight thanks guys I’ll try another time. I know it was last minute but I never get off 3 days in a row so I thought I’d throw it out there

Earthshaker: As grateful as I am for my home diocese, and it is abundantly clear how much grace has been given to us here in southern Alabama, I really miss the diocese of Nashville. Like, I really miss it. There are so many priests who do such good job with the liturgies, on top of being just really good priests. So many churches to choose from, with all different kinds of people. 
Earthshaker: There was nothing bad about mass this evening that particularly set that off. Perhaps I’m nostalgic or sentimental
Earthshaker: I miss the culture of reverence and prayer that was established in the majority of UCat and beyond into the parishes. Auburns campus ministry is WAY behind UCat in general reverence and prayerfulness 
Earthshaker: Perhaps it’s just a culture thing
