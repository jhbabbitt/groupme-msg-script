Sus: What I remember about the rise of the  Saint Ann Young adults is ... is how quiet it was. During the waning hours of the  Catholic frat parties, the Triumvirate was discreetly transferred back to St Ann‚Äôs. It was a silent car ride. We all knew what was about to happen, and what we were about to do. Did we have any doubts? Any private, frat party thoughts? Perhaps, but no one said a word. Not on the ride to St Ann‚Äôs , not when Father gave us a place to pray , and  we marched into the St Ann to pray vespers in community. 
The Crimson Tide: Lol
The Crimson Tide: What a ride
The Crimson Tide: Matthew walking into the McCrucifer party

The Crimson Tide: Yeeeeeeehaw
Sus: Hey Father Fye,

We talked briefly after a mass about the idea of a young adult event where we pray vespers and then get dinner together. This would happen every Monday at 6 pm. You also mentioned getting a key from you to open up the church to have a place to pray. Just let me know what the process is to get the key. But in the meantime as long as the weather isn't too bad, we can pray somewhere outside, like in the courtyard. The current plan is to start this next Monday. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

In Christ, 
Matthew McDevitt
