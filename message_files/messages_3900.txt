The Monkey: Yeah but the thing is I don't feel like Allie or some others like her were in it just for social reasons
The Monkey: You have like Allie or Lauren who were bought in but then whatever reason just dropped off
B2EMO: Lauren is a good case study for this (I don't know what happened to Allie) but it seems like for Lauren as soon as she started. dating, she no longer had any interest in being a part of the Catholic community. If your main goal was to find a partner then why continue being a part of the  Catholic community? Of the evolved over time and is over simplified
The Monkey: It may be an oversimplification to say the only reason she got involved in the first place was because she wanted to find a boyfriend
The Monkey: People's motivations are often more nuanced and can change over time
B2EMO: Yes agreed
The Monkey: I feel like in a lot of these cases we're talking about something must have happened or there was an outside influence that changed their perspective 
The Monkey: Miranda says for Allie that seemed to have been Kelly Semelsberger
The Monkey: or however you spell it
B2EMO: ?
The Monkey: The short girl who was in RCIA
B2EMO: Yes that right
The Monkey: On the inverse it's interesting to see people who didn't engage with the community much at all who have continued to grow past college
The Monkey: Like my vegan friend
Boxi: Weird though, because it always seemed like Kelley was the follower and Allie was the leader in that relationship 
The Monkey: That's what I always thought too
The Monkey: But apparently Kelly was a big part of Allie dropping
Boxi: Kelly weirded me out
B2EMO: I dont know kelly at all
The Monkey: Didn't she have a thing fo you at one point 
Boxi: She was always big sus toward me
Boxi: Unconfirmed
Boxi: @The Monkey 
The Monkey: She wanted to find Hakuna Matata
B2EMO: George Carter is a good example of the inverse
Boxi: But whenever I’m able to find out that vibe without anyone saying anything it’s like, bad, ya know?
Boxi: Literally the biggest oof
The Monkey: XF
The Monkey: XD*
The Monkey: I've been cackling waiting for someone to acknowledge that message
Boxi: @B2EMO The two being discussed
B2EMO: This is a good example of why community is so important and why it can be over-reliant on it at the same time
The Monkey: I guess you could say Kell was the voice insoyd Allie's yead
The Monkey: Kelly* I have Bordiuk fingers tonight
B2EMO: dyslexic* they really did give us the hardest word to spell
The Monkey: It's melancholy boi hours now

B2EMO: I dont know how you operated with so little sleep
The Monkey: I slept between setting up and taking down my catering jobs lol
The Monkey: I would literally just pass in those chairs at the far end of the Beaman atrium 
The Monkey: Pass out*
B2EMO: I was always confused by your none existent sleep schedule because I knew from hell week at the Citadel I could survive on about 4 hours of sleep but you didn't seem to get that lol

The Monkey: Dang y'all outta the loop
The Monkey: Let me just say that nothing bothers me more than when people put "St. Anne" it frustrates me lol
