2004 Auburn Tigers: @The Crimson Tide I expect you to sing the Japanese national anthem if they play it
The Crimson Tide: „ÅØ„ÅÑ„ÅØ„ÅÑ„ÅØ„ÅÑÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
2004 Auburn Tigers: Is it any good
The Crimson Tide: Pog the lyrics of this national anthem are believed to be the oldest in the world currently 
The Crimson Tide: I like it but apparently it's controversial because it was also the Empire of Japan's national anthem lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: Even better lol
The Crimson Tide: Teachers for years would sit during it and got fined for doing so until the Supreme Court ordered Japan ruled it constitutional to require everyone to stand during it 
The Crimson Tide: OOF
The Crimson Tide: Supreme Court of Japan*
2004 Auburn Tigers: Oof
The Crimson Tide: It's really short I could memorize it
2004 Auburn Tigers: That‚Äôs what I expected you to do tbh
The Crimson Tide: It translates to "May Your Reign"
The Crimson Tide: Very imperial lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: Is there any support for it? I don‚Äôt see Japanese people being very patriotic post WWII
2004 Auburn Tigers: Why did they keep it around? Just tradition?
2004 Auburn Tigers: I guess if the lyrics are pre - imperial Japan then you could look at it as not directly supporting it or whatever
The Crimson Tide: It's basically a short poem saying "may your reign last thousands of years" with some poetic analogies
The Crimson Tide: They probably wanted to keep it since they still have an emperor
The Crimson Tide: INTERESTING the current emperor has boycotted the Japanese national shrine honoring Japanese who died in war because there are WWII war criminals there
The Crimson Tide: Down the rabbit hole we go
Sus: Oh no 
The Crimson Tide: Lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: Long love Japan! May you reign for 1000 years!

Sus: True none of them want a united Ireland üáÆüá™ 
2004 Auburn Tigers: You should bring that up next town hall
The Crimson Tide: What about united Korea
2004 Auburn Tigers: United Korea would be pog but it‚Äôs less controversial so it‚Äôs not as good of a meme
The Crimson Tide: Kim Jong-un said "could just be book about farming"
2004 Auburn Tigers: Lol Northern Ireland = North Korea
2004 Auburn Tigers: Basically the same thing
The Crimson Tide: Exactly 
The Crimson Tide: Down with the imperialist fascist Brits
2004 Auburn Tigers: Queen Elizabeth = Kim Jung-un
The Crimson Tide: Does that mean Jong-un is going to die soon
The Crimson Tide: He's only like 40
The Crimson Tide: I literally call banks on a regular basis pretending to be someone I'm not I could make a career as a scammer
