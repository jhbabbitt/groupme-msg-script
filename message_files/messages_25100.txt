One Python Boi: I feel like 90% of my facebook feed won't understand what im saying
One cookie-bakin boi: Yeah
One Python Boi: eh whatever who knows
One Python Boi: it gives people an idea of what ive been up to
One cookie-bakin boi: I need an app that bakes cookies for me
One Python Boi: build a robot
One cookie-bakin boi: Speaking of Publix, apparently Publix has released a new statement banning open carry of firearms on their premises
One cookie-bakin boi: Which when things like that happen in Alabama, people tend to be upset
One Python Boi: lol not in my Alabama
One cookie-bakin boi: Oh hell no war eagle 
One cookie-bakin boi: But yeah, and so now I have a legitimate fear of some kind of demonstration happening
One Python Boi: wow
One cookie-bakin boi: Where like, people come into Publix with their guns just to make people mad or defend their rights or whatever
One Python Boi: silly gun owners
One cookie-bakin boi: I doubt it’ll happen, but you never know
One cookie-bakin boi: Like, what would they do if like, 5 crazy rednecks decided to show up with their rifles? It’d be a mess
One cookie-bakin boi: I seriously doubt people would do that, especially because Publix still allows concealed carry
One Python Boi: yeah just hide your gun
One cookie-bakin boi: I could never carry a gun on me just living my normal life
One cookie-bakin boi: I don’t think it’d be good for my mental health
One Python Boi: I just feel like you have be really paranoid to do that
One cookie-bakin boi: Some people are, yeah, but others (at least here in Alabama) just grew up around them and so it’s just integrated entirely into their lifestyle and so they’re just totally comfortable around them
One Python Boi: they just think danger is around every corner or why would they always carry a gun
One cookie-bakin boi: Yeah but the one time they need it you’ll be damn sure they’re going to use it. Also hunting and such is a thing. Also rural Alabama isn’t the safest place
One cookie-bakin boi: Also the people’s general distrust of the government to ensure justice is also a thing
One Python Boi: Classic Alabama
One cookie-bakin boi: God bless it
One cookie-bakin boi: Lord knows we need it
One cookie-bakin boi: Southern Catholics tho. Now THOSE are some interesting people lol
