GroupMe: Pathfinder One Trick changed name to Aubie is the best mascot
Aubie is the best mascot: So I found this anti catholic Facebook page
Aubie is the best mascot: Their latest post is asking for everyone’s favorite anti catholic memes
Aubie is the best mascot: And ALL of the comments are Catholics posting these hilarious memes or the Protestants posting their images of ugly graphics with their anti catholic stuff or whatever. If I wasn’t sold on my faith before, I am now. Even our memes are better on an anti catholic page
Aubie is the best mascot: It’s so freaking funny
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: I was screenshots 
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Want*
This is the way: lol
Aubie is the best mascot: LOL someone commented “thank you for these additions to my proddies can’t meme folder”
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Where can I find this
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: TELL ME JACOB
Aubie is the best mascot: null
Aubie is the best mascot: I only found it because Nick Rankin commented on it
Aubie is the best mascot: Page is called The Roman Catholic Church Exposed
Aubie is the best mascot: There are a couple proddy memes that are relevant, but almost all are the poorly made graphics that boomers share on their pages all the time that are often about gun control or Trump or whatever
Aubie is the best mascot: The two spongebob ones are my favorites
Aubie is the best mascot: Also the captain heresy one
This is the way: null
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: It sounds like Sola Scriptura doesn't apply to Jesus' teachings on treating others yikes
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Who would win in a fight?
The Magisterium of the Church, thousands of years of writings by saints and theologians, the successors of Peter, and multiple councils and synods of the Church
OR
Scotty Touchet, Internet rando, and his Googled anti-Catholic timelines
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Actually idk if he Googled them he could have used Bing sorry
Aubie is the best mascot: You know what’s wild? There are next to no young people who adhere to the Protestantism of 100 years ago, and there are waves of young Catholics adhering to the Catholicism of 1000s of years ago
