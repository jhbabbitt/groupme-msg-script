Ze Rat (Ze Cook): It would replace dinner Bryce said he will order pizza
Comrade Uncle Max: Gotcha gotcha
B2EMO: Sound good 
B2EMO: When a girl at CrossFit tells me she is going on a retreat this weekend and invites me to a Fellowship Bible Church service … 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Oi
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Matthew is the new magnet confirmed
B2EMO: My reply basically oh I go to St Ann’s I’m Catholic. Then she told me they have a lot of young people attend and they volleyball on Tuesday. I was like cool 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Matthew was like "It takes more than volleyball and young people"
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): "WHERE IS YOUR INCENSE"
B2EMO: We also have young people at St Ann’s and we also have the real presence in the eucharist and we have 2000 years of traditions and theology at not only at St Ann’s but in every Catholic Church across the world 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): But they have Fellowship in the Bible :)
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Doesn't that sound great :)
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Can someone let Ryan know about the Halloween rAgEr we'll be having
Comrade Uncle Max: OOF
B2EMO: I'm going to be honest I'm not really looking forward to this made for more thing
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I had dinner with DiPaolo and he gave me some hot tea on the event 
B2EMO: null
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): In the Jacob's high pitched voice:
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): null
GroupMe: B2EMO removed Ze Rat (Ze Cook) from the group.
Comrade Uncle Max: Lol
B2EMO: You think you have power here 
Comrade Uncle Max: Peace!!!!!
B2EMO: Every time Chris has tea but he doesn’t share it 
Comrade Uncle Max: We’re just validating him @B2EMO 
Comrade Uncle Max: In the future we just need to pretend that his tea isn’t really dramatic
Comrade Uncle Max: Then he will spill
GroupMe: B2EMO added Chris Castel to the group.
Chris Castel: Lol
Chris Castel: I only got the notification that I was added
B2EMO: Are you going to the event @Chris Castel 
Chris Castel: Ja
The Monkey: Is @Comrade Uncle Max 
Comrade Uncle Max: No
The Monkey: Booooooo
The Monkey: You must look beyond what you see, Uncle Max
GroupMe: Comrade Uncle Max changed name to Boxi
The Monkey: "Are you ready for the smoke machine to come out"
The Monkey: - Matthew
The Monkey: Yeah gimme those burritos Matthew
The Monkey: I don't like the new name change it back 
Boxi: Nope
The Monkey: Aster ftw
The Monkey: null
The Monkey: @B2EMO 
B2EMO: That event was not for me 
Boxi: tough
B2EMO: Yeah it was tough staying awake 
The Monkey: I had a nice phat sleep
The Monkey: Never slept so good in my life
Boxi: @The Monkey Does Miranda know about this
The Monkey: Yes
The Monkey: The day she started doing that we both went 
The Monkey: null
B2EMO: Oh no 
Boxi: I wanted to know y’all’s take because it seems like she’s using the correct language to identify her problem, and she getting the help she needs, and I get wanting to share that with others, but yeah, this ain’t it chief
The Monkey: That's like the story of Sofia in a nutshell
The Monkey: She always will admit to the problem but then she decides to do something about it where you're like "what no no no"
Boxi: I get the whole “don’t start a podcast/blog” sentiment, which is its own problem that we have already discussed, but is an easy trap to fall into for people like her
Boxi: But this seems more like a “I’m confusing a wound with my identity” kind of problem
The Monkey: Yep
The Monkey: "The Codependent Catholic" 
The Monkey: The name makes me want to SCREAM
B2EMO: Are you guys ready for my new blog "The Dyslexia Catholic"
Boxi: Oof
The Monkey: YIKES
The Monkey: Matthew is savage this morning
B2EMO: It just seems silly, but hopefully, she manages to help someone who is struggling to be codependent
B2EMO: *not be  I guess that would be the right wording not sure but you get my point
Boxi: It’s just a bunch of misspelled Bible verses and Saint quotes lol
B2EMO: XD
Boxi: Someone just needs to comment on her page “Prayer and the Sacraments”
B2EMO: And going to therapy/seeing a medical professional￼￼
B2EMO: Sometimes you have to cut out the middle man 
The Monkey: :)
B2EMO: That is the most underwhelming tea ever 0/10 ￼
The Monkey: Mmm I don't think you got the whole story anyway lol
Boxi: @The Monkey Whatever happened to Katherine Brophy? Does she still exist?
The Monkey: She hangs out with Allie Canfield and co and tries to get everyone to listen to her music 
The Monkey: Not practicing Catholic anymore 
Boxi: Geez
B2EMO: null
The Monkey: It's the Belmont wannabe artist standard - you gotta leave behind all your friends who won't stan ya music
Boxi: I can’t remember anyone that fell so hard that was so involved at BCC besides Allie and her friends
Boxi: Maybe Rick I guess
The Monkey: Yeah it makes me upsetti spaghetti
Boxi: I just wonder how that all crashed so hard so fast
Boxi: These girls were like, in bible studies and discipleship and stuff
Boxi: And it seems like everyone went down together, you know?
B2EMO: When ever I hear about someone from UCAT falling alway from the faith  
The Monkey: We did the best we could
The Monkey: But their hearts were hardened 
The Monkey: Some seeds will fall among the thorns 
B2EMO: I mean i feel like you start to discover who was in UCAT for social reasons and who didn’t put in the work to maintain their faith post school but who knows what the full context is.
