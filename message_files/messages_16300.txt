Earthshaker: Idk why I laughed at this but I did

No Notifications: Hahaha I made almost that exact joke
Ours: null
No Notifications: Jar Jar is the next character Filoni and Favreau are bringing back
Earthshaker: So if anyone can link me a video or Reddit thread or simply answer this themselves that‚Äôd be great. What all Jedi/force sensitive beings out there could have heard Grogu‚Äôs force Zoom call? Obviously there‚Äôs Luke, and Leia. I haven‚Äôt watched Rebels, are those guys still living? I doubt they bring in Cal Kestis, but he‚Äôs still alive right? Who else am I missing
Earthshaker: Also I‚Äôm COVID negative and Strept throat negative btw
Earthshaker: Like, there‚Äôs no way they make Grogu do this Jedi Temple/force/seeing stone thing without somebody ‚Äúhearing/seeing‚Äù it, right?
No Notifications: I mean, I can tell you who I think the most likely candidate is you're ok with Rebels spoilers
No Notifications: There's really only Luke, Leia, Cal, and Ezra Bridger to choose from aside from like 2 or 3 side characters from novels and stuff
Earthshaker: Okay but it seems like they have no problem yoinking Legends characters
No Notifications: That's true but they dropped a bomb last episode that ties very closely to Ezra
Earthshaker: Right
No Notifications: Improbably close
Earthshaker: Thrawn, right?
No Notifications: If Thrawn is in this show then I don't see a way Ezra will not be
No Notifications: That's all I will say
Earthshaker: Dammit Filoni I‚Äôm going to have to watch Rebels aren‚Äôt I
Ours: Same 
No Notifications: Season 2 and 3 are the only thing you need
No Notifications: Unless you really are hungry for the backstory of Ezra Rex and Ahsoka joining up with the Ghost crew
