One Lead Paint Boi: There it is I knew you'd respond with the appropriate meme
Tidehunter: I really, sadness me when I hear about a trad UCAT group chat it separates the community and isolates itself. It quickly then becomes an arms race on ￼who is the most trad and people will adopt more and more radical views to be a part of the group. 
Tidehunter: It*
Ymir da Tursk: I don’t mean to change the subject but if we don’t find out today then we need to at least begin applying for other places
