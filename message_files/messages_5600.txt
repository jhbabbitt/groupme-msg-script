Sus: lol
The Crimson Tide: Unofficially, approximately 5 days after being given approval for vespers and dinner, the Triumvirate was dispatched to St. Ann with orders to eradicate the lack of prayer in the young adult community.
The Crimson Tide: Had to look up the exact script lol sorry
2004 Auburn Tigers: Matthew = Boba Fett in that mission
The Crimson Tide: I told y'all we were in the post-Knightfall missions lol
Sus: Fr. Fye on David leading the Ann young adults 
2004 Auburn Tigers: “Frat parties?? Frat parties are no good for building community, I need something more real”
“Frat parties will do fine.”
“No they won’t.”
“Frat parties… will… do fine.”
“No! They won’t! You think you’re some kind of leader in the catholic community just hosting Frat parties all the time? I’m an introvert! Frat parties do not build community for me, only authentic friendships. No friendship, no community, no deal.”
Sus: DED 
The Crimson Tide: This is what Nolan Roth sent me at 7 am today lol
Sus: Ok boys what’s the deal with this Friday 
2004 Auburn Tigers: Chris has suggested that you and I make dinner and that he and Miranda would contribute with a dessert
Sus: So what’s happened to watching rogue one or soccer? I really don’t want to cook on Friday. I thought this was going to be a low key event.
2004 Auburn Tigers: Okay since there’s been a lot of confusion amongst all parties I am making an executive decision. I will be going to get StrikeOut on Friday evening, returning with the chicken, and watching the replay of the USA Japan game. Anyone that wants to eat Strikeout here is welcome, just let me know what you want me to get you/y’all. @The Crimson Tide If you and Miranda want to bring a dessert, sides, anything to eat at all, it is most welcome. If y’all don’t, that’s cool too, and I will cover everyone’s dinner. I plan the game to be on between 6:30 and 7. If anyone does not want to participate, there are no hard feelings and I totally understand.
Sus: Cool that works for me 
The Crimson Tide: That sounds good
The Crimson Tide: We just need some of those garlic whatever wings because Miranda probably won't want to eat exclusively hot wings. Other than that no preference.
The Crimson Tide: On a similar note
The Crimson Tide: I know Camden isn't going to say anything about it but her murder mystery party thing had an RSVP deadline a couple days ago. She asked me about it but I think she's afraid of being pushy with y'all.
The Crimson Tide: Just a heads up
