B2EMO: https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/story/4787288/qatar-world-cup-pays-fans-flights-and-hotels-for-good-pr
B2EMO: @The Monkey I bet they pay better then bing 
Boxi: Oof
The Monkey: Or maybe they pay them like they paid the people who built the stadiums 
The Monkey: Or rather this might also help to cover up that
Boxi: No they will be paid, these are Europeans with big social media presences. If they didn‚Äôt hold up their end of the deal it would be even worse PR for them
The Monkey: Ah so like
The Monkey: Pasha Biceps
Boxi: It‚Äôs not about covering anything up, it‚Äôs just about getting people to talk about things other than the human rights issues that they have. Just get people saying ‚Äúwow our hotel was so nice‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwow it‚Äôs really not cool how you execute homosexuals‚Äù
