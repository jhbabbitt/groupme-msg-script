2004 Auburn Tigers: What have you learned so far that will help you in your quest
2004 Auburn Tigers: I think you should start a catholic ASMR podcast @B2EMO 
B2EMO: That editing podcast is very important and that people really idealize the 1950s lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: Oof
2004 Auburn Tigers: Dating just hasn’t been the same since Vatican II
B2EMO: lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: The English mass ruined dating guys
2004 Auburn Tigers: I think we should just go back to arranged marriages
B2EMO: @Ze Rat (Ze Cook) 
2004 Auburn Tigers: -McCrucifer, probably
2004 Auburn Tigers: He’s asleep Miranda put him down for the night
B2EMO: That they are talking about dating and they are both single
2004 Auburn Tigers: This topic just eats at him 24/7 doesn’t it
B2EMO: for sure
B2EMO: he had another podcast on healthy sex life and Christian masculinity
2004 Auburn Tigers: Oof
2004 Auburn Tigers: He probably prefaces all these podcasts with “now I’m no expert” but then gives us a podcast anyway
B2EMO: its like in every investor podcast lol
2004 Auburn Tigers: Present day McCrucifer and soap opera Sofía would’ve made a good match
B2EMO: lol the girl is complaining about party culture in Nashville
2004 Auburn Tigers: McCrucifer thought his podcast date was going well until she started that
2004 Auburn Tigers: Unlucky for him tbh
B2EMO: when they mention fr fye
B2EMO: triggered
2004 Auburn Tigers: He lives
B2EMO: do not speak of him on this scrub podcast
B2EMO: I just think its so funny how they "oh if I ask this person this question I will get the know them better" NO it's not about that, it's about being yourself in a comfortable environment and letting a conversation evolve naturally
B2EMO: You have to put in the time to get to know someone
2004 Auburn Tigers: Or you can just share memes
2004 Auburn Tigers: EZ win
2004 Auburn Tigers: Easiest vocation of my life
2004 Auburn Tigers: Les talk, more memes
2004 Auburn Tigers: Less*
2004 Auburn Tigers: My groupme keeps crashing it’s time for bed
B2EMO: I should write a review of the podcast that like " just get your vocation forehead ez win"
B2EMO: Angela "I will leave a party so empty"
B2EMO: OOOOOFFFFFF
B2EMO: This podcast is really just advisement for how they are both single lol ]
B2EMO: Angela "I don't get asked out that much" Matt "same"  lmao
B2EMO: just date each other so easy lol
B2EMO: finally, the journey is over after 1 hour and 15 mins main takeaways, for the love of God please edit your podcast, two the people hunger for true community.
B2EMO: McCrucifer and David seeing me take over St ann young adults
2004 Auburn Tigers: @B2EMO What day of the week is it
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Well someone got into my car last night and rummaged 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Too bad they picked the car with transmission issues and nothing but old Chick fil A receipts 
B2EMO: Was the car unlocked did they take anything 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): Nothing I'd notice is gone unless they made off with a Chick-fil-A "Care and Grow" card

Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I need like 3 or 4 more months 
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): The used car market is still correcting itself from the pandemic supply and demand
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): In like 3 months prices will go down to normal because of all the repossessed cars that they can't sell
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): And I will have been able to squirrel away a couple more thousands toward the car fund
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): This has been an Unlucky Chris Wednesday

2004 Auburn Tigers: This is a big message to say nothing has changed
