Uncle Max: What is injera
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): It's a sourdough flatbread that Ethiopians traditionally eat a lot of their food on and with

Ze Rat (Ze Cook): They pile saucy meat and stuff on it and scoop it up with chunks of bread and consume
Ze Rat (Ze Cook): I've had it before it's quite tasty. But for 24 dollars it sounds like they're giving you a ton of it lol

Ze Rat (Ze Cook): What time should I set for the order to be ready

Uncle Max: That okay with you? @B2EMO
