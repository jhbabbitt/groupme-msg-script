Communist Heavy: null
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: null
Communist Heavy: GG
But if you close your eyes: Probably the best final ever
But if you close your eyes: At least since 2010, right Matthew?
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Pog I picked a good World Cup to get started I guess
Communist Heavy: Depression 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Americas > Europe Messi proved it
Communist Heavy: I really need to bring my st Ann young adult manifesto to parties 
Communist Heavy: https://www.focus.org/missionaries/sean-mcdevitt
Communist Heavy: It really do be drama Sunday 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Oh?
Communist Heavy: Meh I'm not going to write it out but I can tell you tomorrow 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Are y'all doing vespers tomorrow? Jessie, Miranda, and me will all be out.
But if you close your eyes: Yes still planning on it
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: 26 degrees 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: I hate it here

J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Why is this at the top of my recommended 
Communist Heavy: https://youtu.be/NeIR4-bxpuA
Communist Heavy: Me at work 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Nothing like the smell of defeated Stormcloaks
But if you close your eyes: :(
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: I've decided I'm an Empire man
But if you close your eyes: Booooooo
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: It makes the most logical sense from the perspective of defending against the Aldmeri Dominion and the wellbeing of non-Nords in Skyrim
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Ulfric can suck a toe
But if you close your eyes: Ah yes. All the public executions with no trial was just a mistake
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Preferable to the Thalmor if you ask me
But if you close your eyes: Oof
But if you close your eyes: Everyone takes Ls in Skyrim
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: We'll know what really happened in 2 to 3 years lol
But if you close your eyes: Hopefully
But if you close your eyes: Bethesda would do the kind of thing that would make it ambiguous somehow
But if you close your eyes: I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Yeah I suppose it wouldn't be hard to spin it to where regardless of the civil war outcome the effect on the Thalmor advance is the same
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Or maybe no one wins the war just like they want
But if you close your eyes: They would pull some nonsense like the war is still ongoing
But if you close your eyes: Or there were multiple wars with different outcomes or something
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: But is the Emperor still assassinated ü§î
But if you close your eyes: They would say he ‚Äúdied mysteriously‚Äù
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Not in my game cuz there is no Dark Brotherhood LOL
But if you close your eyes: Right but it could still be canon. Like he can just died suddenly from natural causes, no assassination required
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Oh I see üëâüëâ
But if you close your eyes: Something silly like that
But if you close your eyes: It would be cool though if they could somehow compile the data of players choices and create some kind of canon based on what players typically choose
But if you close your eyes: Like, create some kind of ‚Äúaverage play through‚Äù and build off of that. I think that‚Äôd be cool
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Hmmmm
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: I got a better idea how about a J'zargo side game
But if you close your eyes: I‚Äôd be surprised if there weren‚Äôt mods
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Hmmm nope
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Just ones to buff the OP kitty
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: @Communist Heavy we got some work to do
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Or I guess @But if you close your eyes you are now qualified too
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: We've got our whole team for the Middle-Earth Skyrim overhaul 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: @But if you close your eyes my man in the Publix seafood department wants everyone's shopping to be a pleasure today
But if you close your eyes: He doesn‚Äôt mean it
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Lol
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Car shopping
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: @Communist Heavy lol
Communist Heavy: Miranda and me: join us

Communist Heavy: So are you just looking or are you buying today? 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Oh no I'm taking my time buying 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: The more I walk away the more they'll negotiate
Communist Heavy: @J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus  Finally deciding to buy a car 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: I mean I told them their Civic was a little overpriced for my budget and left and they already texted me offering to knock $500 off
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: And it's still transitioning to a buyer's market
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Don't be making fun of me
Communist Heavy: Yeah I just hate the process of buying a car just let the listed price be the price why do we have to haggle Ôøºto buy a car? It‚Äôs just silly 
J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: Because commissions

J'zargo Has Heard of the Staff of Magnus: I can get two 16 sticks for the price of two 8
Communist Heavy: sure do it

Communist Heavy: lol

But if you close your eyes: I guess if it‚Äôs a mod they cant sue you
