Kaolin the Earth Spirit: ?
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Tell him @Tidehunter 
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: I thought they werenâ€™t responding to the apartments.com thing
I Am the Galaxie Drive: They're physical only lol
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: So I have to come to Nashville
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Not necessarily 
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Please explain to me in clear thoughts what I need to do
I Am the Galaxie Drive: I can scan it and send it to you
I Am the Galaxie Drive: You can then fill it out and scan 
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Send it back
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Are you 100% sure thatâ€™s acceptable
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Of course
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Okay if yâ€™all decide to send it then letâ€™s send it
I Am the Galaxie Drive: I kinda wanna see what Auburn Ln looks like
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Also apparently the Publix on 8th near my Chick-fil-A is paying some people 14 and 15 an hour so jus sayin
I Am the Galaxie Drive: It's brand new
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Pay at Publix is hard to nail down
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Each department pays differently at each store
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: And starting pay changes frequently within each department
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Like when I came in I was making more than some people doing the same job that had been here a year
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Hmmm
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Also your pay can change every 4 months or so
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Pay can potentially increase* I should say
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: So even if you switch stores, if youâ€™ve been with Publix for a while you keep your increases
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Ah
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: But what I donâ€™t know is if the starting pay at the stores in Nashville is all around higher than here
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Because it should be due to cost of living
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Or sales or whatever
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: So I hope I get more just for moving to a busier store
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Hmmmm
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Many questions we must answer
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Also @Tidehunter now is the time to let our landlord know we're leaving
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: We must move quickly
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: The housing market is relentless 
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: If we do not find a place, it will be weed house without end
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: First, I want you to go to Robin Realty
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: We will catch them off balance
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Do what must be done, my roommates
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Do not hesitate 
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Show no mercy
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Only then will we have a house to rent
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Yeah well about that
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Their office was blown up in the Christmas bombing sooo
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Oh heck
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: LOL
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Yeah
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Looks like someone already literally order 66â€™d the place
Tidehunter: I say we fill out our applications as quickly as possible no harm in putting our names in the hat nothing is final until we sign. If we want to look at more places that works for me.
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Ye
I Am the Galaxie Drive: And look at washer/dryer prices
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Publix people are weird man
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Sheesh
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Socially competent managers feel like theyâ€™re few and far between
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Just talk to me 4head
I Am the Galaxie Drive: TIL the longest song in existence is...3.343 quindecillion years long

Tidehunter: I still donâ€™t know who Iâ€™m hacking 
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Patience young McDevitt
I Am the Galaxie Drive: My co-conspirator and I must solidify our plan first
I Am the Galaxie Drive: You'll get your instructions when you fix the damn printer @Tidehunter 
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Like I legit need the printer for this lol
Tidehunter: fine i will take a look at it
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Also I need the application thing or whatever
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Idk if thatâ€™s relevant to the printer or not

Kaolin the Earth Spirit: About to wear a mask to the first ever public Latin mass at my parish since Vatican 2 just to piss off all the right wingers ðŸ™‚
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Hype for high mass though
Kaolin the Earth Spirit: Should be good
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Lads we should have a follow-up talk about the house because we need to get the ball rolling and we all need to get all our thoughts out there before we sign anything
I Am the Galaxie Drive: My thought is tomorrow night
I Am the Galaxie Drive: Do I hear any objections
