Darth Pizza Time: I love Holst
Darth Pizza Time: I haven’t heard Saturn in forever
Darth Pizza Time: I wonder why they put that one in the game. That’s one of the least popular ones
Darth Chinese New Year: Mars or Jupiter would have been a better bet
Darth Pizza Time: There usual order of popularity is
1.) Jupiter 
2.) mars
3.) Venus
4.) Neptune
And then everything else is never played except when you play the piece in its entirety
Darth Burrito: I need to listen to all of them
Darth Pizza Time: If you do, I prefer London Symphony’s 2009 recording conducted by Geoffrey Simon
Darth Chinese New Year: Is that the iTunes one?
