I Want Pictures of Spiderman: Also I didn't mention this but yesterday at work we had the booksack discussion.
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: It went a little like this:
"Have you ever heard the term 'booksack'?"
"Uh, duh, what kind of question is this? Everyone has."
"Let me tell you a story..."

Jacob Babbitt: Y‚Äôall ready for this story? So I‚Äôm on retreat this weekend, and the retreat is all about discipleship. One of the biggest emphases is about how evangelization comes from your own prayer and stuff like that. So tonight I was in adoration praying a rosary for BCC, and I was praying for you guys and a bunch of other people. My thoughts started to wander around how I need to start praying more for BCC people and for whatever reason my thoughts jumped to ‚Äúyou should be a cloistered monk and just pray for BCC for the rest of your life‚Äù and then I pictured not only me, but all three of us becoming cloistered monks, living in one room, shaving our heads, growing beards, wearing habits, making bourbon fudge, and trading hand drawn memes. So I started busting out laughing in the middle of this candle lit adoration and people were staring but I just couldn‚Äôt get the image out of my head of us making bourbon fudge in our habits lol
Darth Plagueis the Wise: lol 
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: What in the world Jacob hahaha
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: This one's for you Jacob
Jacob Babbitt: What

Jacob Babbitt: So occasionally my parents order things on Amazon using my amazon prime account, so that they don‚Äôt have to pay for one or whatever. But for everything they order, I get a confirmation email saying ‚Äúthank you for ordering blah blah blah‚Äù y‚Äôall know how Amazon works. Well I just got this

I Want Pictures of Spiderman: I spend too much time on Wookieepedia
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: Everyone thinks I'm joking about hunting down the production team for Captain Marvel lol
Jacob Babbitt: I have a great idea for a Catholic and prequel meme crossover but I‚Äôm not skilled in the making of the meme lol
Darth Plagueis the Wise: oh no....
Darth Plagueis the Wise: What's your idea
Jacob Babbitt: Today I went to mass and we were saying the penitential rite (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) but anyway I got lazy and instead of putting three syllables in the word ‚Äúgrievous‚Äù I put two so it sounded like general Grievous lol 
Jacob Babbitt: Through my fault, through my fault, through my most general grievous fault
Darth Plagueis the Wise: hhahahhahahaah lol
I Want Pictures of Spiderman: Jacob I am truly sorry to crush your spirit but Garrett Marshall has already posted your idea in Peter's Catholic Friends before
Jacob Babbitt: ‚ÄúYour faults will make a fine addition to my collection‚Äù
