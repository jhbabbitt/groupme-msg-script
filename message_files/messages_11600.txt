Tattletale: Baton Rouge priests literally couldn't care less about confession. They are always late and turn it into some kind of talk therapy and it makes me so mad that they treat it that way. I'm so tired of being told I "didn't need to go to confession" like what does that even MEAN. I WANT THE SACRAMENTAL GRACES CONFERRED BY CONFESSING MY SINS AND RECEIVING ABSOLUTION.
Tattletale: That's my rant. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
