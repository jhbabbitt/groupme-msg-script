Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Aye lads, the more I think/pray about it, the more I think it would be a good idea for me to move back to Nashville. Sometime in the next couple of weeks I’d like to have a more serious conversation about where y’all are at in terms of your next living situations. I know all three of us kind of have multiple options/desires on the table, and we’re not really sure where we’re going next, but I’d like to know where you guys are at in terms of an expected timeline of things and where y’all are at with prayer.
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Even if it begins to trend toward not working out, I would at least like to know what y’all are thinking about doing after your lease expires
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I'm off today and will be available except like 6 to 7:30 if we would like to talk today
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I work late today
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: big sad
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I actually only work until 8
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Well, I’m only scheduled until 8
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Hmmm
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: If I get out on time I could talk at like, 8:30
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Awwwww yea
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Thoughts? @Damn Customer 
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I know that’s two hours past your bedtime
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: "Stonks"
Damn Customer: Hhhmm this is late 
Damn Customer: I can do 8:30 
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I will try to let you know if I will get out on time
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: No promises
Damn Customer: null

Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I talked briefly to the assistant bakery manager about possibly transferring to Nash and she seemed to think it wouldn’t be hard at all
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Boy do I love being set up for failure by my superiors
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: It’s my favorite thing
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: wat
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: What happened
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Just repetitive carelessness and shoving jobs that should be done by them down to the clerks and such
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: And then they ask why we get out so late
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: oof
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I know that feel
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I work for 7.5 hours today
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: One of my jobs usually takes me 3.5-6 hours to complete, depending on if we’re getting a delivery or not
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Today we don’t get a delivery, but they only scheduled me to do this job for 3 hours
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: But one of the tasks in this job is to do all the dishes, but wait, I’m scheduled for this at 1:30. And they know damn well that most of the dishes aren’t available to wash (because the things on them haven’t been packed and out) until AT LEAST 4:00
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: But now that everything is packed, I can’t do the dishes because I’m the only one here and I have to take care of customers
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: So I have 1-2 hours worth of dishes to do after we close
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: Whoops sorry Jacob
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: My manager literally said “well that sucks for you I guess”
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Big F
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: That sucks my guy
