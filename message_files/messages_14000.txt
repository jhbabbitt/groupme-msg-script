One Lead Paint Boi: She says she hopes we enjoyed our peaceful night without Rick because she had to deal with him @Tidehunter 
One Lead Paint Boi: Lol little last minute don't you think Rick
Tidehunter: null
One Lead Paint Boi: Sounds like his third guy flaked on him
Tidehunter: I just cant think of why someone would do that 
Ymir da Tursk: I’m surprised Cassie and Rick don’t just move in together
One Lead Paint Boi: For real
One Lead Paint Boi: I've learned many interesting things I didnt realize about Cassie 
Tidehunter: But their is only one question that matters why is she dating Rick  
Tidehunter: So internet will be 39.93 a month￼ it more because of the router 
One Lead Paint Boi: I mean that's just 13 per person that's not bad
One Lead Paint Boi: Lol @Tidehunter 
One Lead Paint Boi: You gotta talk to Rick 
One Lead Paint Boi: If you dont leave your room Rick can't accost you
Tidehunter:  ￼that’s the strategy
Ymir da Tursk: What’s going on with Rick
Tidehunter: Just that the new roommates are moving in on may first 
Tidehunter: And I told him that we will be long gone bu then 
Tidehunter: By*
Tidehunter: So my understanding is that I need order another cashier’s check for 2250 before we move in? Right?
One Lead Paint Boi: Great question
Tidehunter: well that what her email said
One Lead Paint Boi: I thought it was just the 574 specified in the agreement
One Lead Paint Boi: I see what you're saying now
One Lead Paint Boi: Yes

Tidehunter: My recommend is to get rid of the printer 
Tidehunter: *Recommendation￼*
Tidehunter: @One Lead Paint Boi 
Tidehunter: I tried getting into IP address to even downloading the crappy app to and adding it that way and it still won’t work. The printer outputs are so old that I don’t have a cord that could connect to the printer directly.
