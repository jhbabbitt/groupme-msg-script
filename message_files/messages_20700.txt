Sando Aqua Monster: Agreed

Supreme Chancellor: I'm back 
Big Gooberfish: Boy do we have some stories for you tonight
Big Gooberfish: Ok Pete definitely said his headache went away immediately after he realized his head was touching the monstrance did he not
Sando Aqua Monster: Something like that
Big Gooberfish: Heck
Sando Aqua Monster: Why
Big Gooberfish: Well if that's true that's pretty miraculous is it not
Sando Aqua Monster: It is
Big Gooberfish: And that's pretty cool
Sando Aqua Monster: I just didn’t know if something had JUST happened that made you ask
Big Gooberfish: No I just processed it lol
Big Gooberfish: And I was like "OH"
Big Gooberfish: Also after we talked about temperaments I went and took as many variants as I could and phlegmatic was my overwhelming result @Sando Aqua Monster 
Sando Aqua Monster: Not surprised
Sando Aqua Monster: I bet you’re phlegmatic - melancholic
Sando Aqua Monster: Matthew and I are Melancholic - Phlegmatic
Big Gooberfish: Odd man out lol
Big Gooberfish: Remember when I said Epic Church was super obvious?
Big Gooberfish: The URL is literally "we are relevant" lol
Big Gooberfish: @Isaac "one final time with my disciples"
Big Gooberfish: Ok I'm over the Fr G saltiness I miss Awakening a ton now
Big Gooberfish: There are none left
Big Gooberfish: "Keep him on a short leash" EXCUSE ME @Sando Aqua Monster 
Big Gooberfish: how you gonna like my message and not answer my text yo
Big Gooberfish: @Sando Aqua Monster 
Big Gooberfish: I just screwed up 15 emails for work this is a huge yikes
Big Gooberfish: Big oof
Big Gooberfish: I'm so embarrassed ahhhhhhh
Supreme Chancellor: RIP
Supreme Chancellor: Also Pizza Rev is closing 
Big Gooberfish: WHAT
Supreme Chancellor: Yup
Supreme Chancellor: F
Big Gooberfish: They can't do that - shoot them or something!
Sando Aqua Monster: F for @Big Gooberfish 
Sando Aqua Monster: F for Pizza Rev
Big Gooberfish: null
Big Gooberfish: 100% emailed like 30 churches and said "I know you and your team at ___ church are busy with blah blah" and put the wrong church in those 30 emails
Big Gooberfish: Some of them are fudge-able but 15 or so are just straight-up garbage emails
Big Gooberfish: Always double-check when templating emails boys
Sando Aqua Monster: Oof
Sando Aqua Monster: Not even Origi could save you yesterday @Supreme Chancellor 
Supreme Chancellor: Yeah true but I really only care about the premier league this year 
Sando Aqua Monster: WHAT
Sando Aqua Monster: THAT LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE
Sando Aqua Monster: THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE DOMESTIC LEAGUES IN EUROPE IS TO PLAY IN THE EUROPEAN TOURNAMENTS
Supreme Chancellor: Well we’ve never won the premier league 
Supreme Chancellor: We won the champions league last year 
Sando Aqua Monster: And I’m sure you’ve never won the League 1 title either lol do you want to be relegated so you can win that trophy too
Supreme Chancellor: Now I’m just confused 
Sando Aqua Monster: The champions league is the biggest club tournament in the world
Sando Aqua Monster: Winning the title in England is great and all but it’s an objectively smaller trophy than the Champions league
Sando Aqua Monster: And especially considering your current form in England, you should EXPECT to at least make the semifinals in the champions league
Sando Aqua Monster: But now you’re down 1-0 aggregate to the FOURTH BEST TEAM IN SPAIN
Sando Aqua Monster: I’m done with you
Sando Aqua Monster: You fair weathered fan
Supreme Chancellor: null
Big Gooberfish: Weirdos
Sando Aqua Monster: Prayers for me please, lads
Sando Aqua Monster: Struggling with a few things post-awakening. 
Big Gooberfish: I love when church website say "one church, two locations"
Big Gooberfish: Catholic Church says hello. One Church, hundreds of thousands of locations lol
Sando Aqua Monster: One church, literally the universe 
Sando Aqua Monster: Also their website should say “one ecclesial community, two locations” lol
Big Gooberfish: One heretical community of Christians not in communion with Rome
Big Gooberfish: Lol gooood 
Supreme Chancellor: Lol
Sando Aqua Monster: https://youtu.be/cyAhzxlHJ3U
Big Gooberfish: Awwwww yeah here we go
Big Gooberfish: New Zach Janson Thursday 
Big Gooberfish: I don't know why I'm so amused by this
Big Gooberfish: null
Sando Aqua Monster: It was then that Zach finally snapped, never to be heard from again by anyone acquainted with Chris Castel
Big Gooberfish: "Can you imagine if Thomas made an audiobook? It would take hours. He'd read like 2 sentences and then go on an hour tangent." - Zach Janson on Thomas Villalobos 
Big Gooberfish: I got him to come to FOCUS lunch on a whim
Big Gooberfish: "I could say 'I just went to Mars' and Jacob Babbitt would say 'Good, good. Excellent.'"
Big Gooberfish: He's got you pinned Babbitto
Sando Aqua Monster: Lol what does that even mean
Big Gooberfish: Idk but he was on a roll with the impersonations
Big Gooberfish: He did Matthew too
Supreme Chancellor: Ooff
Big Gooberfish: New development
Big Gooberfish: I'm mad so please excuse the rant but Fr G won't reimburse me any cash from my fundraising to pay for other Peru costs
Big Gooberfish: And I'm livid
Big Gooberfish: Because I am not paying out of pocket for this trip and if that's what he wants me to do then I am not going down without a fight
Supreme Chancellor: null
Supreme Chancellor: Fight him 
Big Gooberfish: You have no idea how prepared I am to stand my ground on this
Big Gooberfish: I raised this money and told all my donors it would be to help me and I should have a say what do with my money should I not? Am I wrong in thinking that?
Sando Aqua Monster: So where’s it all going if you can’t keep it
Sando Aqua Monster: Or use it for other Peru costs
Big Gooberfish: If I dont designate it to anyone or everyone is fully funded the Diocese just takes it as a donation
Big Gooberfish: I'm planning to help Isaac since he's getting married soon and that's a huge cost but he only needs like 1000 and I have like 2000+ left over
