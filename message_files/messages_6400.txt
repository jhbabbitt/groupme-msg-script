#BEBETTER: Literally the chief critics of the series aren't even criticizing that it's about the disregard for the lore
#BEBETTER: Whack
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Is it really that bad?
#BEBETTER: I haven't seen
#BEBETTER: Only read reviews
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Idk man, I’m neither a Tolkien-ist neither am I a right winger but all I can think of is that this was meant to be a mythology for the British people, no?
#BEBETTER: Idc what color they make elves but I care about blatant disregard for the source text and reviews do not make me hopeful 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Like, I’m not malding over a race issue but people really seem to think they ignored some of Tolkien’s descriptions for some agenda
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Like, it seems to go deeper than the issues people had with what’s her name in the Kenobi series 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Idk, I haven’t seen it either and I don’t plan on watching it, and obviously people shouldn’t throw any hate at actors that are selected for these roles
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: I just wonder sometimes with these reboots of old classic worlds if they sit down and say “how can we create a show that appeals to non fans so that they will watch it and enjoy it and fans will watch it and hate it and we’ll maximize profits”
Lowe’s Hater: I blame capitalism 
#BEBETTER: What a shocker lol
