The Monkey: Someone has to have written about it
Yekindar: @The Monkey People have, but it‚Äôll be hard to find sources that are unbiased
The Monkey: True

The Monkey: LOL
The Monkey: Woof
Yekindar: It‚Äôs important to remember that most people don‚Äôt actually care about the council itself. Most ‚Äúbad‚Äù things that happened as a result of the council were already happening or people were wanting them to happen
Yekindar: Remember that loads of seminarians right before the council went to seminary because they thought the church would make priestly celibacy optional
Yekindar: Stuff like that
The Monkey: Wait what
Yekindar: Yeah you didn‚Äôt know that
Yekindar: There was like, a whole generation of priests that were ordained who thought they would be allowed to get married when the council closed
The Monkey: null
The Monkey: This is the first time I've heard that
Yekindar: Of course I‚Äôm using a pretty sweeping generalization, but yeah there were rumors that the church would let priests get married, and so some guys went to seminary and full on got ordained but the secretly (or not so secretly) hoped that the church would change its teaching
Yekindar: They*
Yekindar: And of course the seminaries at the time were *garbage* so anything flew at that point
The Monkey: Crazy stuff 
Yekindar: Yep. So all the documents came out and everyone just went wild, especially those priests that had just been ordained

Yekindar: Are we setting in stone that we‚Äôre trying to watch the World Cup Round of 16 games on Saturday, December 3rd? If the US makes it out of their group, this is most likely the day that they will play. Games are at 9 AM and 1 PM. The US would be the 9 AM game
Yekindar: The other option if the US somehow makes it out is they would play the next day, Sunday December 4th at 1 PM
GroupMe: Yekindar changed name to Beat England Again
