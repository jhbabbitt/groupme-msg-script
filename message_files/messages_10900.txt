Bruno of Cologne: Because he’ll get VAC banned and then he won’t play TF2
Black Krrsantan: Alright boys. We should all work on cleaning the common area this evening for the wild Fr Fye encounter tomorrow. I also thought today would be good to talk about cleaning duties so that we don't have to while Fr Fye is at our meeting.
Bruno of Cologne: Father volunteered me to help with the “lay minister’s” version of the blessing of the throats after mass
Black Krrsantan: Hahahaha

Black Krrsantan: Liturgical dance when
Bruno of Cologne: Also talked to father after mass
Bruno of Cologne: He definitely forgot about dinner tonight
Bruno of Cologne: He had no idea what I was talking about
Bruno of Cologne: But he’s coming
Boba Fett: Classic father Fye 
Bruno of Cologne: He was like “oh I have to tell the KoC council I won’t be at their 4th degree meeting”
Bruno of Cologne: Cancelling meetings for us poggers
Black Krrsantan: He literally said that when I talked to him about it last week lol
Bruno of Cologne: LOL
Bruno of Cologne: “I have done nothing but forget about dinner on Auburn Lane for 3 days!”
Black Krrsantan: "Question: I forgot about dinner on Auburn Lane"
Bruno of Cologne: null
Black Krrsantan: I still don't have an office key and everyone is late today so I'm just hanging out in the hallway
Black Krrsantan: AYYYY
Black Krrsantan: That bugger was hard to make I just want to put that out there
Bruno of Cologne: Idk if that was the finished product or not @Black Krrsantan 
Bruno of Cologne: But that’s what I found
Black Krrsantan: That was ir
Black Krrsantan: It
Black Krrsantan: Work colleagues want to do a happy hour tomorrow can I get approval for the half a glass of something that I will at most drink
Bruno of Cologne: We can talk about it tonight?

GroupMe: Bruno of Cologne changed name to “RIP Awakening”

Black Krrsantan: Just like Awakening 
“RIP Awakening”: OOF
“RIP Awakening”: OOF SIZE LARGEEEE
Boba Fett: BIG OOFF
“RIP Awakening”: SHE’S STILL AT IT
Boba Fett: She has grown too powerful 
Black Krrsantan: She told me this morning that she is now also convinced you actually have crack in your gummies
“RIP Awakening”: @Black Krrsantan Faith in your new apprentice… misplaced may be… as is your faith in gummy-less sleep
“RIP Awakening”: “Father Fye has probably been to a lot of formal dinners. He might know the difference between a salad plate and a dessert plate”

Fr Fye: lemme just put butter, salt, pepper, and parsley on my French bread for the lols
“RIP Awakening”: Chad
Boba Fett: null
Black Krrsantan: Interesting
“RIP Awakening”: Bad idea
“RIP Awakening”: Really bad idea
Boba Fett: Yeah I'm honestly not sure what to think of it 
Black Krrsantan: But we can do it and then eat Chipotle's soy chorizo Jacob
Black Krrsantan: Or I can get some from Trader Joe's 
Black Krrsantan: Or I can get some from Trader Joe's 
Black Krrsantan: Even GroupMe dislikes that I guess because it wouldn't send it
“RIP Awakening”: Some serious questions about why you’re doing it need to be asked before you do something like this
“RIP Awakening”: Especially in public
“RIP Awakening”: It’s not a good look
“RIP Awakening”: This kind of thing is not rooted in tradition, nor is it recommended by the church
Boba Fett: The first thing that came to my mind isn't that just too much. Exodus 90 is hard enough.
Boba Fett: Part of me thinks that the reason that this has come up is that they want to prove to everyone how tough they are. The point of Exodus 90 isn't to make you tougher it's to make you holier. ￼
Black Krrsantan: @Boba Fett I am NOT enjoying the pretense of liking this Old Fashioned I am literally dying
Black Krrsantan: Also I drank too much too fast and choked and now my head feels funny I regret everything

“RIP Awakening”: He’s ending peoples careers
GroupMe: “RIP Awakening” changed name to Peppered French Bread
Black Krrsantan: I'm on my way home I expect a full report
Black Krrsantan: I didn't even drink a quarter of that Old Fashioned golly that was rough
Boba Fett: With all the alcohol, you could have gotten why an old fashion you didn't like it the last time you tried it

Black Krrsantan: Board games tonight?
Black Krrsantan: We got the time and everything
