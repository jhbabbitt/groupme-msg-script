Trumpet 1 in C: I‚Äôm getting quite sick of Jeremy‚Äôs attitude
Joseph DiPaolo: Oh shoot where did this come from
Joseph DiPaolo: What's going on?
Trumpet 1 in C: We were messaging the a few days ago and I was like ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm probably going to have some big news in a few days, can‚Äôt wait to share, blah blah blah‚Äù in regards to Israel, but I hadn‚Äôt committed yet.
Trumpet 1 in C: And he was like ‚Äúyou have enough money for me to come back to Belmont???‚Äù
Trumpet 1 in C: And I said no
Trumpet 1 in C: And then I messaged him today and told him I was going to Israel and all that and his only response was ‚Äúare you taking me with you??‚Äù
Trumpet 1 in C: Idk maybe I‚Äôm being selfish or his tone is being lost over text but I‚Äôm trying to share something exciting in my life with you in hopes that you can partake in that joy, but you just want to turn it into how you‚Äôre still stuck in Singapore
Trumpet 1 in C: Just be happy for me, even if you are jealous or whatever
Joseph DiPaolo: No I think that's valid
Trumpet 1 in C: I just had a long day at work so I‚Äôm going to wait until I‚Äôm in a better mood to respond
Joseph DiPaolo: I've felt that Jeremy has struggled with kind of thing. And he never wanted to talk to anyone who would actually address that it felt like.
Joseph DiPaolo: Ben got the worst of it probably.
Trumpet 1 in C: Yeah I don‚Äôt know
Trumpet 1 in C: Idk it just rubbed me the wrong way
Joseph DiPaolo: I think that's valid but you have to be willing to be kind yet firm
Strider: I honestly don‚Äôt understand his love for Belmont even after what they did to him 
Joseph DiPaolo: I just don't understand Jeremy lol
Trumpet 1 in C: Easter time
