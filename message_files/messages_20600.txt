Big Gooberfish: My dad's coming to town Sunday so if this isn't resolved by then we will likely enter into a boss match 
Supreme Chancellor: Anakin is just so unchaste
Sando Aqua Monster: Y’all ever crave caf pasta?

Supreme Chancellor: lol
Supreme Chancellor: So what’s everyone doing for lent 
Sando Aqua Monster: Idk yet for sure but I have ideas
Sando Aqua Monster: @Supreme Chancellor I know you don’t live there anymore but Nolensville is getting a parish
Big Gooberfish: I'm doing the fasts we did for Exodus 90 for Lent like is recommended *cough cough*
Sando Aqua Monster: I’m probably doing some of the fasts but I’m not really in a place where doing them all would be healthy
Big Gooberfish: And what about you Mr. Like-Happy Memer @Supreme Chancellor 
Supreme Chancellor: I think I'm going to YEET youtube and maybe some other fasts
Big Gooberfish: COLD SHOWERS
Supreme Chancellor: No
Big Gooberfish: Yes
Big Gooberfish: You can just join the "Lent 40" group with Patrick and the gang
Supreme Chancellor: Being clean is not keeping me from being close to Christ
Big Gooberfish: You are dust and to dust you shall return
Big Gooberfish: Lol
Sando Aqua Monster: Y’all are goons lol
Big Gooberfish: Thanks coach 
Big Gooberfish: Be afraid
Big Gooberfish: @Sando Aqua Monster wanna play TF2 hehe
Sando Aqua Monster: Witch I’m at work
Big Gooberfish: Classic
Big Gooberfish: Do you think my sniper skills could transfer to CSGO?
Sando Aqua Monster: Ummm it could, but probably not immediately 
Sando Aqua Monster: It involved incredibly different mechanics and stuff
Sando Aqua Monster: Sniping in CS requires much more movement and positioning skills than TF2 does, but it also doesn’t have a charge up and the AWP is a one shot kill to almost everywhere on the body
Sando Aqua Monster: In TF2, spy is the only thing that can hard counter a good sniper. Nothing else has the immediate range to deal with him. If you know anything about positioning in TF2, you can funnel to the point where the only threat you have is spies
Sando Aqua Monster: In theory at least
Sando Aqua Monster: In CS, if you miss a shot with the AWP, even at long range, you’re probably dead if you re peek because rifles and even some pistols have to range to kill you in one shot
Sando Aqua Monster: Again, in theory
Big Gooberfish: Oi
Sando Aqua Monster: There’s also the economy system to consider about CS. If you’re low on cash and you buy an AWP, and you die, not only are you handing the best gun in the game to the other team, you’re not going to be able to buy another one for another 2-3 rounds, even if you win those rounds
Sando Aqua Monster: All that to say that aim is aim and transfers from game to game
Big Gooberfish: K guess I'll stay a TF2 normie
Sando Aqua Monster: I’ll let you know when you can conga in CS
Big Gooberfish: HEADSHOT CONGA 
Supreme Chancellor: null

Sando Aqua Monster: Thoughts? @Supreme Chancellor 
Supreme Chancellor: It's really good. Tolkien is totally immersed in this world which is great. But sometimes I feel like he goes into a lot of detail to the point it's not important to the story. Making it hard to continue reading. Part of that is kinda on me because I've seen the movies and played the games. So a lot of lore I already know. Overall it's really good and I'm looking forward to reading the Two Towers.
Sando Aqua Monster: That’s most peoples only issue with Tolkien lol
