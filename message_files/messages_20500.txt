Tom Bombadil: @I Am an Ent Idk if he eases back or it just feels like he eases back with everything going on @I Am an Ent 
Tom Bombadil: Idk why I tagged you twice
I Am an Ent: Tom Bombadil and the last chapter of Return of the King were the greatest losses in the movies
I Am an Ent: Second to last*
Tom Bombadil: I think the ending is a much bigger loss than ole Tom bomb-dill-o
Strider: mmmmm......
Strider: I was reading those chapters I was like I totally understand why this got cut out
Tom Bombadil: Lol
Strider: its so weird
Tom Bombadil: Classic Tolkien
I Am an Ent: It also makes sense why the chapter we can't spoil for Matthew was cut
I Am an Ent: But it's SO good
Tom Bombadil: I mean
Tom Bombadil: Maybe logistically
Strider: honestly, so far I have been impressed by how well the movies adapted the books
I Am an Ent: It would ruin the pacing of the movie
Tom Bombadil: But not narratively 
I Am an Ent: Movies are a very different medium from literature
Tom Bombadil: Yes Chris
Strider: change your profile image @I Am an Ent 
I Am an Ent: No Jacob
I Am an Ent: No Matthew
Tom Bombadil: We’ll let Matthew decide

Treebeard: Hahahahahahahahaha
Tom Bombadil: Heck
Treebeard: So Nolan asked that freshman out and she said no oof
Tom Bombadil: I thought they were dating
Tom Bombadil: ???

Treebeard: Apparently she thought they were at too different of points in their lives
Tom Bombadil: Lol what

Strider: We should just go back to arranged marriages jk 
Treebeard: Honestly tho the only problem would be our society would hate it
Treebeard: I've actually thought a lot about the merits of arranged marriages lol
Tom Bombadil: I mean
Tom Bombadil: Discerning someone else’s vocation for them isn’t exactly the best idea
Tom Bombadil: IMO
Treebeard: I think that's looking at it from a modern perspective of discernment and vocation
Treebeard: Arranged or not, you learn how to love another unconditionally in a marriage
Treebeard: Ideally at least ope
Treebeard: From my perspective, I just don't know how arranged marriages could stay so long in a Christian society unless God really wanted them to
Treebeard: Lol a coworker at my internship sent me this
Tom Bombadil: Aye lads, big news. I recently applied for and got invited to go to Israel and possibly parts of Europe with the Community of the Beatitudes. Same thing Ben is probably doing, except my pilgrimage could potentially be much longer (as many as 4 months). Please please please pray for me. I really want to go, but I also want to take time and properly discern, and if I am to go, which trip I’ll go on and for how long. I can’t stress enough how big this could be for discernment as well as just general spiritual well being, not to mention all the graces that come with praying with scripture in the holy land. 
Tom Bombadil: [insert Jacob going on a crusade memes here]
Treebeard: HECK
Treebeard: I already got a response on an application I sent in yesterday.
Treebeard: Lots of exciting things going on for us
