Treebeard: @Tom Bombadil what is the Tchaikovsky symphony you said is your favorite?
Tom Bombadil: My personal favorites in order are 
5
4
6
Everything else
Tom Bombadil: Most of the world thinks 6 is his best
Treebeard: Nah son 2
Tom Bombadil: ?
Treebeard: 2 is best 
Tom Bombadil: Why
Treebeard: I've never heard his second symphony lol
Treebeard: I'm trolling
Tom Bombadil: The thing about the 5th symphony is that the finale carries it
Tom Bombadil: IMO
Tom Bombadil: The rest of the movements are pretty good, but the finale makes it what it is
Tom Bombadil: If that makes sense
Treebeard: üëÄ
Tom Bombadil: I have plenty of other classical stuff if you‚Äôre interested lol
Treebeard: Catacombs is my favorite part of Pines of Rome by far
Treebeard: I mean I won't say no
Tom Bombadil: Catacombs is my favorite but not by a long shot. I love all 4 movements
Tom Bombadil: The Pines of the Appian was is just 5-6 minutes of full sends
Tom Bombadil: Appian Way*
Treebeard: I mean I like all of it too
Treebeard: I just live for the second movement

Tom Bombadil: I got yelled at so much
Tom Bombadil: I‚Äôm so over it
Treebeard: Yikes

Treebeard: This is an official panel from a canon Star Wars comic depicting the Battle of Mimban lol
Treebeard: As is this
Tom Bombadil: what lol

Treebeard: But that first panel makes Jar Jar look like freaking Rambo hahahahaha
Treebeard: null
Treebeard: This is officially my favorite piece of Star Wars media
Tom Bombadil: saber-lighty
Treebeard: Mesa love da saber-lighty
Tom Bombadil: Also what poor Jedi will be forever remembered for having Jar Jar pick up their lightsaber after they‚Äôve been killed?
Treebeard: Laan Tik
Tom Bombadil: F
Treebeard: Shoot dude
Strider: ?
Treebeard: Just listening to the score for A New Hope for all the cues is magical because it tells the story as much as the actual visuals
Treebeard: Like even if you were clueless you could still tell that Luke has decided to go with Obi-Wan when the Force theme plays as he sees the burning farm
Treebeard: HECK
