Come out ye dark and daedras
Come out and fight me like a true warrior
Show your daedric lord how you won battles in Oblivion
Tell them how the Nerevarine made you flee like a skeever away
From the green and lovely hills of Vvardenfell

Come let us hear you tell
How you slandered great Uriel
When you thought him well and truly persecuted
Where are the sneers and jeers
That you loudly let us hear
When our leaders of the Blades were executed
M'aiq the Liar: Come out ye dark and daedras
Come out and fight me like a true warrior
Show your daedric lord how you won battles in Oblivion
Tell them how the Nerevarine made you flee like a skeever away
From the green and lovely hills of Vvardenfell

Come tell us how you slew
Them old Stormcloaks two by two
Like the skeevers they had swords and shields and bows
How bravely you faced one
With your enchanted ebony sword
And you left them shaking in terror until their dying breath

Come out ye dark and daedras
Come out and fight me like a true warrior
Show your daedric lord how you won battles in Oblivion
Tell them how the Nerevarine made you flee like a skeever away
From the green and lovely hills of Vvardenfell
M'aiq the Liar: Now the time is coming fast
And M'aiq thinks the days are here
When each Imperial n'wah, he'll run before us
And if there'll be a hand
Then Khajiit will say "warm sands"
With a verse or two of singing this fine chorus

Come out ye dark and daedras
Come out and fight me like a true warrior
Show your daedric lord how you won battles in Oblivion
Tell them how the Nerevarine made you flee like a skeever away
From the green and lovely hills of Vvardenfell
