Librarian Jocasta Nu: Gotta add shoulder caps and some hems to the arms and then it's time to mold and mount the plates

I Miscalculated: null

Trumpet 1 in C: @I Miscalculated it was Adam’s brother who died not Alan’s
I Miscalculated: Yeah Isaac told me
Trumpet 1 in C: Sheesh
I Miscalculated: Fr G misinformed me
I Miscalculated: I think he got confused with names
I Miscalculated: I'm watching your earlier stream rn when you were Arabia @Trumpet 1 in C lol
I Miscalculated: Classic Alexander
I Miscalculated: You should have bought that cotton tile to deny it to him!
Trumpet 1 in C: @I Miscalculated Am I good Arabia
I Miscalculated: I mean Arabia only gets kicking once you hit Medieval so I can't really comment on that
I Miscalculated: I would have taken policies and research a little differently - you weren't building any wonders but you still took aristocracy first 
I Miscalculated: Aristocracy is only good if your capital pop has either hit 10 or you plan to spam Classical wonders, which you'd need a really good production start to do.
I Miscalculated: I also think Arabia is better as a Liberty civ since it's big on dom and you want a lot of decentralized production to spam camel archers
I Miscalculated: Ok I'm done
