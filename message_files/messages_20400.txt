Tom Bombadil: @Strider 
Tom Bombadil: That sucks
Strider: @Tom Bombadil  driving to Nashville 
Treebeard: Octavio just gave away tix
Treebeard: ...in the UCat chat
Strider: Well I didn’t really care about game I was just looking forward  to going with Ben
Treebeard: Lol Matthew is checking in with his Belmont ID

Treebeard: We are training Matthew as a liturgical dancer
Strider: null

Strider: all that good Publix stock
Strider: well keep applying to places
Strider: @Treebeard 
Tom Bombadil: @Treebeard You don’t even have to move up. You just have to hang around
Treebeard: :o
Tom Bombadil: null

Treebeard: Summary: Tom Bombadil is the greatest character in LotR
Strider: nah
Treebeard: How dare
Treebeard: How can you not love jolly singing Tom Bombadil 
Strider: he is  great but not the greatest character
Treebeard: Lies dirty lies
Treebeard: Why would Babbitto be named after him
Tom Bombadil: Lol
Treebeard: I'm kinda angry. Again.
Treebeard: I'm angry a lot lately. Maybe I need prayers for that.
Strider: what are you angry about
Treebeard: It's the board again
Treebeard: But it's really hard for me not to get worked up to see what the three of us worked so hard to improve back at the same place it was almost 3 years ago
Treebeard: And Carly and etc but you know
Treebeard: I just can't fathom the amount of carelessness and irresponsibility and lack of dedication
Strider: Yeah I know its hard because we dont really have any control anymore
Tom Bombadil: It’s okay to be angry
Tom Bombadil: But we must also remember how great a victory Jesus has won for us on the cross, and (as the monk supposedly said) our Lady has already crushed the head of the serpent
Tom Bombadil: It’s been incredible, amazing, and downright crazy how God has worked in BCC over the past four years. ESPECIALLY amidst everyone’s failures (ours included). Perhaps 3 broken sophomores will move in together next year, and have their hearts set ablaze by each other and love for their greatly imperfect community. Maybe that’s his plan. Like in the gospel tonight, where sin abounds grace abounds all the more
Tom Bombadil: We must pray for those on board, the missionaries, father Gervan and for UM!
Treebeard: Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party amirite @Strider

Treebeard: Catholic Charities cut the event I was supposed to be doing for my Honors capstone
Treebeard: A month out
Treebeard: Two months out from graduation 
Tom Bombadil: Yikes
Treebeard: What the heck am I supposed to do
Treebeard: I planned it for 4 months
Treebeard: Time to pull out my list of people in high places I know...it's empty
Tom Bombadil: Drop out
Treebeard: ...
Treebeard: Wow God bless Tim Stewart
Treebeard: The director of the Office of Service Learning replied to my email in 15 minutes
Tom Bombadil: So what’s the plan
Treebeard: He put me in contact with one person and said he would reach out to others
Tom Bombadil: What was the original event
Treebeard: Diocese art competition focusing on homelessness and poverty
Treebeard: USCCB sponsors it nationwide and has a national level competition from the diocesan winners
Strider: Did you know that this event would likely fall through? 
Strider: Lol dropping out is what all the cool kids do 
Treebeard: No it was literally spelled out to the letter the framework and it's been done in Nashville for years 
Treebeard: The national winner last year was from Nashville 
Treebeard: But this year they're like "nah"
Tom Bombadil: Any neighboring dioceses participating?
Treebeard: Plenty. Pretty sure Louisville is.
Tom Bombadil: Well maybe you can Yeet your project to another diocese?
Tom Bombadil: Or would it not work the same
Treebeard: They're probably almost done
Treebeard: The national level deadline is March 31
Treebeard: I should have gotten out when the director said she didn't want a large event
Tom Bombadil: Why are they cancelling
Treebeard: Idk they just don't want to put any assets time or effort into it despite it having clearly tangible positive results
Treebeard: And they literally have a free worker to do it
Strider: Well it's time for plan b 
Tom Bombadil: And they know you need this to graduate and they’re just cancelling just because?
Treebeard: Shoot the Crusades Part V weren't supposed to start for another 10 years Matthew
Strider: It’s time to retake the holy land 
Treebeard: I don't know the whole picture but yes they know that. It's not officially cut...just downsized to the point where it's basically a classroom art project for like 10 students in the Diocese
Treebeard: Yo Matt Maher slaps 
Strider: When Catholic Charities of Tennessee has a bad website RRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Treebeard: This memo on my phone contains the entirety of the strategy I used to win the Mongol scenario on Deity
