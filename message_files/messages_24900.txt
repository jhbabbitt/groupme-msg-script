Spiritually Genghis Khan: Aislinn is trying to bring back Salt and Light Night
One cookie-bakin boi: Because the board needs more to do?
Spiritually Genghis Khan: Idk I wasn't at the meeting because of work
Spiritually Genghis Khan: I have no clue what happened but Miranda said that came up and I am ready to stand my ground against it unless someone has a really good idea to make it better
One Python Boi: null
Spiritually Genghis Khan: Ok apparently everyone took up arms against her nevermind we're safe
Spiritually Genghis Khan: God bless Megan Quinn
One Python Boi: I can never get a read on Aislinn
One cookie-bakin boi: At the end of the year board retreat we talked a lot about bringing back an event like salt and light, but it would be very different from the ones we knew
One cookie-bakin boi: Megan Jones and Natalie were pushing for it
One cookie-bakin boi: I honestly think it could be done, but not with the board in its current state
Spiritually Genghis Khan: Yeah precisely we do not have the framework which is why I don't think it would be any better
