I Miscalculated: Oooof
Tera Sinube: TF2 is a lot like CoD for me, it’s just not balanced enough to be fun. You just die all the time and feel like there’s nothing you could’ve done about it
Tera Sinube: CoD team deathmatch and other select modes*
I Miscalculated: Que est "cheese" tho

Tera Sinube: It’s tough for me when Jeremy and I have been trying to FaceTime for like, two weeks now, unable to find a time, and when we do find a time he’s like “whoops, I forgot this artist is doing a livestream sorry”
Tera Sinube: I’m trying so hard to understand but I really really struggle

Tera Sinube: The other day I was cashiering and the older lady came through my line with just one bottle of wine. At Publix if there’s a chance that they don’t want a bag, we ask them if they want one, that way we save our bags and the environment or whatever. So I ask her if she wants a bag, and she says yes please. So I start to put it in the bag and she leans in and says “wrap it up tight to the top, can’t have these other Baptists seeing me walk out of here with alcohol”

I Miscalculated: So CtK had Mass outside on their field...
I Miscalculated: And two randos walked up to the fence during communion and the deacon GAVE THEM THE EUCHARIST 
Tera Sinube: And they took it?
Tera Sinube: I mean, benefit of the doubt says that they’re parishioners and the deacon knows them? But yeah
I Miscalculated: Idk
I Miscalculated: It weirded me
Tera Sinube: Liturgy question:
Tera Sinube: Did y’all stand for the Sequence today?
Tera Sinube: And do y’all know if we’re supposed to or not
Tera Sinube: Because everyone at my mass stood but I think it was just “second reading is over, I hear music, I stand” sort of thing
Tera Sinube: But neither my priest nor my deacon stood
Tera Sinube: So I remained sitting as well
