Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: @Lowe’s Hater I have already told Chris this but I wanted to capture your reaction live for our entertainment 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: I had my first session like I was telling you about
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: And he suggested I get tested/learn more about ADHD

Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: HMMM
Lowe’s Hater: The real reason 
#BEBETTER: Sarah O'Connor will be in the same place at the same time every Sunday from September to May Matthew, time to make your move
#BEBETTER: Forget the zoomy cars
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Reject cars
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Return to magnetism
#BEBETTER: Jacob's girl run-ins and memes are but fleeting
#BEBETTER: Matthew's just keep giving
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Yes
Lowe’s Hater: Only the strong meme survive ￼
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Yikes lol
#BEBETTER: Maybe Mary Amsler will ask Matthew to join her support team
#BEBETTER: I just want Farmer Matthew back
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Isn’t she dating someone
Lowe’s Hater: Oh no we can’t have these type of memes on the same day as lighthouse 
Lowe’s Hater: Yes she is 
#BEBETTER: Shhhh
#BEBETTER: Farmer Matthew 
#BEBETTER: Nothing else matters 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: It’s LIGHTHOUSE DAYYYYYYYY
Lowe’s Hater: Farmer Matthew vs Auburn Matthew 
Lowe’s Hater: null
#BEBETTER: Yeah but the speaker is Fr. Gregory Pine
#BEBETTER: Maybe we'll get some decent content for once
#BEBETTER: Inb4 Fr. Gregory Pine says "I moved and then found my crew in the Dominicans"
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Nah he’s great
#BEBETTER: It was a joke you nutcracker 
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: No u
#BEBETTER: I've been had
#BEBETTER: null
Lowe’s Hater: Oh no 
#BEBETTER: She needs a way to Jacob amirite
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: 🙄
#BEBETTER: LOL
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: I was telling Matthew that I should’ve taken up her offer and gone to the lake with them just for the memes
#BEBETTER: Ded
#BEBETTER: I didn't know they offered that
#BEBETTER: This meme just got 10x better
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Yeah she was like “we’re going to the lake today if anyone wants to come!”
Lowe’s Hater: It would of been legendary ￼
#BEBETTER: Hahahahaha
#BEBETTER: Well Miranda says she knows Pete's girlfriend so
#BEBETTER: Q&A will be hosted at UCat reunion lol
#BEBETTER: She says not to worry about the girl, only Pete should be of concern
#BEBETTER: That she will either "shape him up or she will ship out"
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Hmmm
#BEBETTER: She had a long-term boyfriend before Pete that died so
#BEBETTER: I would be inclined to think anyone like that would not be rushing into a relationship
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Pete definitely implied that he rushed into the relationship
#BEBETTER: That doesn't mean it's on both sides is the point Miranda stressed to me
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: We obviously have no idea what her perspective is
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Right
#BEBETTER: Yeah 
#BEBETTER: But if this is the case then Miranda is confident Pete will be sent packing
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Hmmm okay
#BEBETTER: This is your afternoon tea report
#BEBETTER: Come back tomorrow for more tea
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: But what do you think that does for his faith though if she’s not Catholic
#BEBETTER: In terms of that I think there's cause for concern because she's pretty solidly Methodist or whatever
#BEBETTER: Like very much so according to Miranda
#BEBETTER: And we know Pete can be easily influenced to go to other faith events like accepting the Mormons' invites without second thought
Lowe’s Hater: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm…………..
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Yeah it almost makes me feel worse about the whole thing lol
#BEBETTER: Get this man in spiritual direction ASAP
#BEBETTER: Make him read all the church doctors and Augustine and Aquinas and Scott Hahn
#BEBETTER: Yes I know Scott Hahn is an outlier there lol
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: The good news is that Pete has more fortitude in his faith than sometimes we give him credit for. A lot of times it comes from all the wrong places, but he’s never had a real crisis or temptation that we know about to completely abandon the faith. Then again he’s never had a girlfriend be the crux of that but still
#BEBETTER: That's the part that worries me
#BEBETTER: He gets highly erratic and unpredictable whenever there's a girl of romantic interest involved
Lowe’s Hater: Boys at this point I just think Pete is just going to be Pete. But I was not that  encourage￼d when talking to Pete it sounded that core faith difference ￼had not really been talked about with her. Even though he reassure￼d me it wasn’t a issue 
#BEBETTER: 🤔
#BEBETTER: I've got the perfect solution
#BEBETTER: null
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Is this how we’re dressing at the party on Saturday?
#BEBETTER: Yes 
#BEBETTER: GO FORTH INQUISITORIUS
#BEBETTER: QUASH THE HERESY
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Is he confirmed coming on Saturday?
#BEBETTER: Pete? I didn't think he was coming at all
Steve’s Upper Right Terminal: Oh I thought that’s what you meant by this
#BEBETTER: No I meant with Miranda haha
Lowe’s Hater: It looks like Fressia will be at the reunion 
#BEBETTER: Did I tell y'all she texted me the day before the wedding asking where our registry was so she could buy us a gift since she was "in town"?
