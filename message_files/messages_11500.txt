I Just Want the Sacraments: Good thing I didn't send this email where the first sentence reads "Since we've all paid December rent already"
Tech: Pay rent my guy 
I Just Want the Sacraments: You can take 100 off the top for it Matthew and I will just take our 100 off in January
Berry Hill PD: I mean, I could also Venmo y’all but if you think that’s easier that’s fine
I Just Want the Sacraments: What
Berry Hill PD: ?
I Just Want the Sacraments: Venmo what
Tech: I think just vemmo would be easier 
Berry Hill PD: I can just take the $300 off my payment and then Venmo y’all each a hundo
I Just Want the Sacraments: Hondo Ohnaka
I Just Want the Sacraments: I'm in
Berry Hill PD: But whatever works for y’all
Tech: That’s the simplest solution 
I Just Want the Sacraments: null
I Just Want the Sacraments: Hondo memes are the new meta
GroupMe: I Just Want the Sacraments changed name to Hondo Ohnaka
Hondo Ohnaka: The correct response should be: "Start a religious order" but no one will get it
Hondo Ohnaka: https://www.thedailybugle.net/
Hondo Ohnaka: Now this is marketing
Tech: Lol
Hondo Ohnaka: They're literally producing in-universe TikTok content

Tech: Wtf how would we unplug it 
Tech: And the shower is never getting fixed 
Hondo Ohnaka: I told those dummies that literally all the other components work

Tech: Time for fallout shelter 
Berry Hill PD: Ugh

Hondo Ohnaka: I think this is what's down there
Berry Hill PD: I had a dream last night that Miranda was pregnant, but instead of taking her to the hospital when she was in labor, @Hondo Ohnaka took her back to this house, in which @Tech and I still lived for some reason, and put on Lord of the Rings for her to watch as she birthed their first child
Berry Hill PD: So like, @Tech and I were in a different room, but we could hear Miranda screaming in pain and she was giving birth, but blasting from the TV was the battle for Helms Deep
Hondo Ohnaka: What the heck lol
Tech: Lord of the wings doesn’t get canceled for any reason I guess 
Berry Hill PD: Super weird dream lol
Hondo Ohnaka: I'm gonna have to bail on Lord of the Wings unfortunately. My grandmother's health is declining very rapidly and she's now in the ER so I'm leaving Saturday instead of Monday.
Berry Hill PD: Many prayers
Hondo Ohnaka: @Tech did you get any packages from the lady across the street recently?
Tech: No 
Hondo Ohnaka: Well she left me a voicemail like a week ago saying she had like two so
Hondo Ohnaka: I guess I better call her 
Tech: Well I’m not missing any packages 
Tech: I forgot who Spider-Man is????????
Berry Hill PD: Who is Spider-Man?!?!? He’s a menace!

Hondo Ohnaka: Thank you for your prayers my grandmother is still holding strong and she's improved from the critical condition she was in. Not sure what the future holds because her odds aren't great but I was really worried I wouldn't make it in time to see her so it's a big relief.
Tech: That’s great to hear!
