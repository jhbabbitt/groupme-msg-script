Tera Sinube: Going through old PL is an experience unlike any other
I Miscalculated: Reading old Bryce PL is fun haha
Tera Sinube: I found all the PL from when I was Jesus
Tera Sinube: It’s funny how I can narrow down who wrote each one by the size of the paper, color/type of paper, and the way my name is written on the outside
Tera Sinube: Colored paper cut into thin strips + feminine handwriting = Jenn Knerr most of the time
Strider: Did I pull a sneaky one on you when you where Jesus with my pl  
Tera Sinube: What do you mean
Tera Sinube: You wrote me a couple
Strider: The writing on the outside didn’t look like my hand writing or something 
Tera Sinube: I mean, yeah, some of them I can’t tell but still
Tera Sinube: Also, Josie McCann is a freaking legend
Tera Sinube: She literally gets her entire family in on her intentions
Tera Sinube: Like, she collects intentions for her friends from her entire household
Tera Sinube: So her PL is like “we’ve offered 15 rosaries and 5 masses” lol
Strider: classic
Tera Sinube: I haven’t even come across any from Will Braeuner but I know there are probably a dozen but they’re all at the bottom of the bag
Tera Sinube: Also Margaret Gupton’s handwriting is freaking artwork

I Miscalculated: At Matthew's request I am practicing Mirage and Inferno in CS:GO
I Miscalculated: We played Mirage in Wingman that one time @Tera Sinube 
I Miscalculated: Right
Tera Sinube: We played inferno that one time
I Miscalculated: U sure
Tera Sinube: Yes mirage has no wingman
I Miscalculated: O u rite
I Miscalculated: I'm on it now
Tera Sinube: Mirage is best map
I Miscalculated: That's what Matthew keeps telling me
I Miscalculated: Wait wait Mirage is the one with Palace right 
Tera Sinube: There is a Palace on Mirage, yes
Tera Sinube: By A site
I Miscalculated: Yeah that's what I meant
I Miscalculated: I understand now
Tera Sinube: Okay lads tentative plan
Tera Sinube: I just ate a meal (brunch? Idk), so I’ll probably eat again right as I leave Auburn at 3, and then eat dinner when I arrive in Nashville. So idk if y’all want to go somewhere or order takeout or something, but I will be trying to eat when I arrive. Cool with y’all? Let me know the plan
I Miscalculated: I suppose that's acceptable 
Strider: Are we getting cookout tonight?
