Tattletale: The "professional" world is even less punctual than customer service stuff
Tattletale: That's what I've learned 
Tattletale: I'm the tech guy at the office now lol
Tattletale: So...the roaches in the basement are actually probably attracted to the humidity so it looks like the dehumidifier was important all along. The attic roaches are probably either the source colony or an entire colony of it's own and the ones in the basement are stragglers from outdoors.
Tattletale: These are the things I've learned today discussing with a pest control company. They've offered to treat for $189 with a 30 day warranty in case the roaches are still around.
Tattletale: Also we have American roaches which are objectively less invasive than German ones and only reproduce at half the rate so count your blessings.
Tattletale: That's all for your roach education today
Tech: Do they do spiders too
Tattletale: I dont think the spiders are that bad
