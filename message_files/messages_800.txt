Not Stonks: I don't know if I would say interesting 
M'aiq the Liar: null
Not Stonks: Yeah that's about right 
M'aiq the Liar: But I did learn some good Auburn unicycle lore
Not Stonks: For sure that was the best part
M'aiq the Liar: Apparently I zoned out of like 75% of the spicy stuff 
Not Stonks: Oooooffff 
M'aiq the Liar: Miranda just now revealed to me the surrounding context before I brought Notre Dame seminary up
M'aiq the Liar: #justADHDthings
M'aiq the Liar: And I forgot about the autism thing immediately until @Small Business Owner just texted me about it
M'aiq the Liar: Probably not best to linger on it though so anyway
M'aiq the Liar: Plaza Mariachi
Not Stonks: Now that I think about it seemed like everyone was catching bullets for no reason 
M'aiq the Liar: null
M'aiq the Liar: Anyway Plaza Mariachi has open salsa lessons at 7 on Thursdays apparently and Bryce and Joseph and Camden are down to go so all we gotta do is lock down a Thursday 
Not Stonks: When I get offered a position but they have too many red flags 
M'aiq the Liar: Uh oh

Small Business Owner: When Apple releases its own app for classical music and you can actually find good recordings based on parameters that’s actually matter in classical music
M'aiq the Liar: Do wat
Small Business Owner: So if I search “The Planets” it will actually filter by piece. Like it understands that not every classical piece of music with “Planet” in it is what I’m looking for. You can see the composer first, as opposed to the recording ensemble. You can see it has 526 recordings of Holst’s “The Planets”
Small Business Owner: So when I click on the planets it gives me a little synopsis, as well as the most popular recordings and an “editor’s choice” recording. You can see also the year it was recorded, which is SUPER important with classical music, and the duration
M'aiq the Liar: HMMMMMM
M'aiq the Liar: Tasty
Small Business Owner: And then you can filter by those things. So you can say “hey, I want to hear the average slowest/fastest” or “I want to hear how they interpreted this piece at this time”, etc. which was all a PAIN to navigate in Apple Music
Small Business Owner: And it was even worse in Spotify, at least back when I tried it years ago
M'aiq the Liar: Spotify hates classical music lol
M'aiq the Liar: I think I've read that it's pretty well understood that Apple Music is by far the better choice for classical 
Small Business Owner: This app would’ve been a godsend if I was in music school
Small Business Owner: It was still a pain, but yes @M'aiq the Liar. And it’s even better now, unless there have been changes to Spotify or there are other classical music listening apps that I’m not aware of
M'aiq the Liar: No Spotify is still trash for classical or anything that's not mainstream music 
M'aiq the Liar: Even like classical guitar recordings by single individuals or especially traditional folk music outside of America and Western Europe 
M'aiq the Liar: Utter trash
Small Business Owner: This app could still use some work, you can tell they just ported over anything with a classical tag to it, so there are some like, middle school honor band albums on here that could be yeeted 
M'aiq the Liar: LOL
Small Business Owner: I don’t want to listen to the 2018 Pennsylvania middle school all state orchestra
M'aiq the Liar: Where's the Auburn Middle School band or whatever
Small Business Owner: Get ‘em outta here
Small Business Owner: Obviously a superior ensemble
M'aiq the Liar: I wanna hear them do Jupiter 
Small Business Owner: null
M'aiq the Liar: No I wanted to hear Auburn
Small Business Owner: Lol
