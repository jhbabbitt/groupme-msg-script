The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤡
Sneaky Babbittses: Imagine applying to work at Publix and not even getting an interview
The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: WOOF
Lord chaos elmo: DAMN 
Sneaky Babbittses: It’s okay Matthew I’ll teach you how to bake
Lord chaos elmo: I’m sorry boys but I’m going on the silent retreat. I need the time to pray and just a break from everything. I think I would fell awfully if I skipped the retreat just for a house party.  
The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: I understand where you're coming from and I don't want you to suffer spiritually. But I don't appreciate this being dropped out of the blue 2 weeks out, after we already invited 30 people. I can't afford to mentally or monetarily invest that much in this party. You dropping means Jacob and I would have to shoulder a lot more burden, which I'm personally not willing to do for my own sanity. So if you're serious about this I think we will just cancel because I would not be healthy.
Lord chaos elmo: So what were you expecting of me 
Lord chaos elmo: Keep this in mind @The Mouth of Chaos Elmo this party is only as grand and complex as you make it 
Lord chaos elmo: I will do what ever I can to help before I leave for the retreat 
The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: I wasn't planning anything grand or complex. But hosting 30 people is a lot of work and that's why it concerns me.
The Mouth of Chaos Elmo: I just would have liked to have known that you were on the fence before I invited people that's all
Lord chaos elmo:  its my bad I double booked￼ myself and I needed to make a call 
Sneaky Babbittses: If y’all plan on changing any plans for this event, I’m okay with that. Whether that means canceling or just changing logistics. Just let it be known that I am working that morning, so I cannot be there to help @The Mouth of Chaos Elmo until 2:15 PM at the earliest. I can give my manager a heads up that I have to leave right at 2 no matter what, but that’s the best I can do. Obviously I will do whatever I can in preparation for before the day of.
