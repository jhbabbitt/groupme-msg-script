Two sad boi: Ok hold on
Two sad boi: I do not support this
One sad boi: support what

Two sad boi: null
One sad boi: In terms of chasing
Two sad boi: I will chase you with a CTK novus ordo Mass
Two sad boi: Processing brass players and all
Three sad boi:  I’m one speedy boi 
One sad boi: Lol
Two sad boi: Matthew got coaxium in the engine
Three sad boi: Speech Latin and they look confused and run away 
Three sad boi: Speak* 
Two sad boi: The only thing that has changed for us is that the roasts are more clever now that we know each other
One sad boi: True
Three sad boi: I do kinda feel bad now that Chris is in a relationship we just roast him and he can’t really roast us back. 
One sad boi: Lol
One sad boi: I don’t feel bad
One sad boi: It’s the natural sad boi reaction
One sad boi: Just two lonely bois 
One sad boi: Making fun of one not lonely boi
Three sad boi: This is true 
One sad boi: @Two sad boi How do I get girls to like me
Three sad boi: Act like a freshmen 
One sad boi: Damn son
One sad boi: Geez lol
Three sad boi: I guess I'm throwing heat tonight 
One sad boi: I think you meant to say “throwing shade” back then lol
One sad boi: Which is quite the opposite of throwing heat if you think about it
Three sad boi: Yeah I guess 
Two sad boi: You guys are freaking relentless
One sad boi: Okay it wasn’t me this time
Three sad boi: Yeah that's on me 
Two sad boi: I also find it ironic that Jacob is asking how to get girls to like him as if he doesn't have a horde of them already
One sad boi: Name a single girl that currently likes me
Two sad boi: I could name a single girl but if you asked them then they might not be single anymore
One sad boi: Let me rephrase 
Two sad boi: That joke didn't translate well
One sad boi: Name one girl that currently likes me
Three sad boi: Didn't Sofia have a crush on you at some point? 
One sad boi: I got it lol
One sad boi: I’m led to believe she didn’t because if she did what she did to Chris and didn’t like him, she never did anything like that to me
Two sad boi: Lol I also confronted about that and she was like nooooo
Two sad boi: It definitely was a thing 
One sad boi: Wait what?
Two sad boi: Not a negatory no, but an embarrassed no
One sad boi: Oh
One sad boi: Unlucky
Two sad boi: Plus she said some things to me in like October that were pretty obvious
Three sad boi: ? 
Two sad boi: She thought they weren't but they were and it was a lil uncomfy lol
One sad boi: Wait what happened 
Three sad boi: ???
One sad boi: How did I not know about this 
Two sad boi: She said something to the effect of an older boy not noticing her at some point shortly after my surgery and I felt a little sick to my stomach
One sad boi: I knew there was a conspiracy but not that there was evidence
Two sad boi: Katherine was trying to expose her and stuff and it was this whole little ridiculous drama circle
One sad boi: I’m beyond confused
Two sad boi: No you're one sad boi
Three sad boi: Oh Freshman
