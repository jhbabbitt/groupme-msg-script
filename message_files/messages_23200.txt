Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: The vegan pizza to me looked like a green light
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Maybe that was the broccoli crust
One Single Boi: Chris proves to me that really have no understanding of women
Pathfinder One Trick: TBH, I’d rather be you with those stories than some of the stories I have with female interaction, especially before sophomore year
One Single Boi: I*
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Would you rather sit on the counter or floor
One Single Boi: lol
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: A classic
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Also "If I kissed you with peanut butter on my lips"
Pathfinder One Trick: Okay, not the story I was thinking about, but that also applies
Pathfinder One Trick: Heck I forgot about that
Pathfinder One Trick: HECK
One Single Boi: How could you forget
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Remember when it then happened to me
Pathfinder One Trick: Idk that was a long time ago!
Pathfinder One Trick: I’ve never had more women aggressively chase me as I did sophomore year
Pathfinder One Trick: In fact it pretty much stopped after sophomore year
Pathfinder One Trick: And yet the meme continues
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: tldr Jacob peaked sophomore year
Pathfinder One Trick: There was literally 3-4 at once
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: I remember very clearly us three sitting in Subway together discussing Lauren texting you about her dreams
Pathfinder One Trick: She would Snapchat message me!
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: We were all huddled over your phone reading about her dream about jet skiing with you and the Pope or something
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Oh yeah so you couldn't screenshot lolol
Pathfinder One Trick: She sent me this super long Snapchat message one night about how she admires my faith but how I was also attractive but mostly the faith lol
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Big yiked
Pathfinder One Trick: It was her, Angie Espinoza, and the UT girls
Pathfinder One Trick: All at once

Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Miranda and I looked at each other and had a lil giggle
Pathfinder One Trick: You should have let them all in on the memes now that I'm gone
Pathfinder One Trick: maybe the memes will keep the memes from happening
Pathfinder One Trick: reverse psychology or something like that
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Oh I've told Sofia and Camden all about them
Pathfinder One Trick: @One Single Boi good on you for having no romantic endeavors btw
Pathfinder One Trick: we all wish we could be as chaste as you
One Single Boi: You cant stop the memes
Pathfinder One Trick: yikes that came out wrong but oh well lol
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Maybe we should write a book together that's just a collection of stories from Russell 010
Pathfinder One Trick: I thought Camden was part of the meme
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: "Three Plebs, a Chair, and a Creaky Bed"
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: I might have told her about that lol @Pathfinder One Trick 
Pathfinder One Trick: might have?

Pathfinder One Trick: yikes
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: She does not take care of herself spiritually, mentally, or physically
Pathfinder One Trick: unlucky
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Apparently Phi Mu fines you 100 bucks for missing a meeting or leaving early and they went late and she missed Benton Mass
Pathfinder One Trick: yay greek life
Pathfinder One Trick: woo
Pathfinder One Trick: big fan of greek life here
Pathfinder One Trick: if you couldn't tell
