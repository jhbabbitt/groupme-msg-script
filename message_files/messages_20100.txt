Tom Bombadil: Oof
Strider: I will be starting out remote at healthstream 
Strider: I was a little afraid they where going to delay hiring me 
Tom Bombadil: How comfortable are you starting out remote?
Strider: I mean the rest of my team is remote so I would basically be doing the same thing just from the office. It just sucks that I have spent 4 months at home and now I will have to spend even more time at home. At the same though I’m really lucky I can work at home and make money and have a low chance of getting the virus.
