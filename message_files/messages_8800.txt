Pre-Vatican II Kentucky Derby: Fake fans
Pre-Vatican II Kentucky Derby: Today, of course, commemorates the day that St Patrick himself led the brave and valiant IRA against the evil British, and expelled them from Ireland along with the snakes, and then he drank a Guinness in celebration as he established a government that ruled a free and united Ireland 
Lord chaos elmo: lol 
Pre-Vatican II Kentucky Derby: It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm sure the Brits have found some excuse to make St Patrick and reformation Saint 
Pre-Vatican II Kentucky Derby: A*
