Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Yeehaw we love the Church
Aubie is the best mascot: Like, there are very few young Protestants who are the old fashioned, sit in a church and have the pastor preach for an hour, sing hymns, really believe in sola scripture sort of stuff
Aubie is the best mascot: Most people are going to the light shows or they’re making their own faith via bible studies with their friends
This is the way: Well for most Protestants it's more like going to a concert
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Sola Scriptura is literally just there to push against Catholics it feels like sometimes
Aubie is the best mascot: Young Protestants @This is the way 
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: WOW THIS MUSIC IS SO ENERGETIC SO MANY PEOPLE WOW I FEEEEEEL THE HOLY SPIRIT
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Ok that was a tad uncharitable but you get my point
Aubie is the best mascot: Hahaha
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: There's a whole generation of Christians that believe that the psychological rush of going to a concert is equivalent to the presence of the Holy Spirit
Aubie is the best mascot: Again, we’re generalizing here, but yes
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: Ok but by and large the current young generation definitely falls in this category 
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: It's a product of society 
This is the way: Protestantism realizes so much more on feelings and being charismatic
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: I just think that focus on feelings is harmful to true faith because in the end it isn't about you
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: I mean yes we have feelings and they are important and valid as feelings but in the end that's not what it's about. 
Cloudy with A Chance of Incense: You can be charismatic and love praise and worship and still realize that your faith isn't about what you get out of it all the time
