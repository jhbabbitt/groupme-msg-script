Earthshaker: I have a good story to tell y‚Äôall, so prepare yourself for a bunch of messages
Earthshaker: At youth group, we alternate weeks where we do things as a whole group, and weeks where we do guys and girls bible study. Keep in mind this is 7th and 8th graders only. High schoolers do different stuff
Earthshaker: So tonight was bible study night. First we played a game as a whole group then we split into guys and girls
Earthshaker: I was leading the guys tonight, so as soon as the game was over I went into the room where the guys were meeting and started getting situated.
Earthshaker: Because middle school is so clique-y, a bunch on the smarter, nerdy kids sat towards the front on my right, while the older, more athletically inclined kids sat in the back
Earthshaker: But there wasn‚Äôt enough room in the back for all of them, so one of them had to move and sit with the nerdy kids in the front.
Earthshaker: So he goes up and says ‚Äúhey, can I sit here?‚Äù
Earthshaker: And one of the kids turns in his chair and says to him ‚ÄúYou are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master. Take a seat, young sky walker‚Äù
Earthshaker: I literally lost it
Ours: lolol
Earthshaker: And of course the older kid didn‚Äôt get it. He was just like ‚Äúcool‚Äù
Earthshaker: So anyway, I have now made it my personal mission to take this young padawan under my wing
Ours: @Earthshaker  When you heard that
Earthshaker: His soul will be yote into tradness as well as prequel memes
Earthshaker: This is my story. I hope you enjoyed
No Notifications: hahahahaha
