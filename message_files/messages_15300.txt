Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: I got into this whole argument with this lady because the cake she wanted had to get approved by a decorator
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: But she says she can’t do that because she works every day until 4:30, which is after the decorators are gone
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: So I had to find this whole workaround so it doesn’t need approval
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: She was upset, I was upset
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: I finally finish taking her Uber complicated order
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: And she asks to pick it up at noon

Damn Customer: Are you on administrative leave now lol
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Fr G got in trouble today
Damn Customer: for whar?
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: He had a homily about temptation vs actually committing sin and his example was "If I was mad at Jen Mahr and wanted to kill her"
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: And he kept going back to that over and over about the "temptation to kill her vs actually killing her" and it was big cringe and Jen was crying after Mass and he apparently had to send an apology message
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: null
Damn Customer: OOOFFFFF that's big cringe what a bad example/joke

My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Isaac and I talked about it all dinner
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: What did Isaac have to say about it
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Like, did he say it was really bad
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: He made a meme and posted it in the GroupMe to call Fr G out lol
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Oh yeah Isaac said it was real bad
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Omg
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Don’t call people out with memes lol
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Well it was after Fr G posted that whole apology
Damn Customer: Im going to be honest this doesnt surprise me
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I mean I'm not surprised either
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Isaac said he recently learned that Fr G held a grudge against Quinn all year because he called him out on not doing morning adoration with them and I was like how can you hate Quinn Cowan
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: It just feels like he bullies people around sometimes to me
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: At least he apologized
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: I know it’s unacceptable but still
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Yeah that's good but still the whole homily just got livestreamed representing UCat
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: And there were cathedral parishioners in attendance 
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Hmm
Damn Customer: Hey I dont know how father G manages the burn bridges with everyone
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: And STILL be in charge
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: That part baffles me
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: In case you were wondering what Isaac sent
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Yeahhhhhh idk about that one Isaac
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I mean was it very prudent or appropriate to send that? Probably not but I still laughed.
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I was just shocked he did it lol
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: I just wouldn’t be surprised if he hears about that from someone
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Whether it be Alan or Jenn or Father himself
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: I mean it was his decision 
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: If there are consequences there are consequences, just like there are for ragging on customers at Chick-fil-A
Aquaman: Real Estate Mogul: Yes
