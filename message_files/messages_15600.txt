My Lord, Is That...Canon?: No one ever complained about the cold on Hoth. We never felt it.

Snowtrooper on Tatooine: I didn’t like Cal as a character very much. He’s too OP. I didn’t like the whole “he can use the force to time travel/see the past” thing
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: It’s like he learns the force abilities out of order
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: Well Cal Kestis doesn't like you
My Lord, Is That...Canon?: How bow dah

Snowtrooper on Tatooine: It’s probably both let’s be real
Snowtrooper on Tatooine: He needs to be comfy as he punches nuclear launch codes
