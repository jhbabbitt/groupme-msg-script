M'aiq the Liar: LMAO
M'aiq the Liar: Nonononono
M'aiq the Liar: That fire does not need any more fuel
Not Stonks: null
M'aiq the Liar: Huge pog
M'aiq the Liar: Lol a chat where Sophie is one of the only people who can send messages? Hard pass
Not Stonks: The great groupie civil war 
M'aiq the Liar: Also that terrible use of parentheses is bothering me so much
Small Business Owner: LOL
M'aiq the Liar: Your typo makes it even funnier lol
M'aiq the Liar: Zack Lewis' groupies vs Sophie's groupies
Not Stonks: Classic auto correct lol 
Small Business Owner: Last night Joseph said “I think Sophie has resigned herself to a less administrative role in the young adults community. I think she understands that she doesn’t need to control it now.”
M'aiq the Liar: LOL 
Small Business Owner: null
M'aiq the Liar: I can't tell if Joseph is in denial or he just doesn't see it
Not Stonks: r/agedlikemilk
M'aiq the Liar: Ded
Not Stonks: I think Joseph in some ways sees himself in Sophie and just gives her a lot of leeway ￼
M'aiq the Liar: Well I'll be sure to grill him on it tonight
Small Business Owner: To be fair, it’s not that he tried to justify any of her previous actions, he just said he didn’t think she would do something like that again
Small Business Owner: Which was major copium, but it’s not like he was like “oh, these things weren’t as bad as they seem”
M'aiq the Liar: Even then if you talk with Sophie for more than 10 seconds you can get a feel for where she stands and that she is definitely still wanting control and administrative power
M'aiq the Liar: Idk maybe we just have a different perspective 
Small Business Owner: Joseph also sees her more often and sees when she actually succeeds in like, bringing people to events and stuff like that, which is why he snorted the copium
Small Business Owner: He basically said “she’s been doing good things for Cathedral bible study and women’s group on a personal level, and I think she understands that that is the more important mission”
M'aiq the Liar: null
Small Business Owner: But obviously she wants control
Not Stonks: null
Not Stonks: null
Small Business Owner: Who’s going to send this to Joseph
M'aiq the Liar: Where did you get all these pictures of Joseph Matthew
M'aiq the Liar: @Not Stonks you should do the honors 
Not Stonks: null
M'aiq the Liar: Weird response
M'aiq the Liar: I've gotten a wild hair and am asking ChatGPT to help me come up with ideas for a website
Small Business Owner: What
M'aiq the Liar: All will be revealed in time
Small Business Owner: null
Not Stonks: Well, boys, yesterday I got fired from Clarishealth with one month severance. I knew one day this day would come. They said it was because of the reorganization of the teams and not base on performance. I'm doing well for the most part Im financially well prepare for this scenario and don't think the job hunt will take very long. The most frustrating part for me is the timing of this because now I won't be able to buy a house, and I will just have to wait a year and try again. But in the end, Nashville has tons of houses, so I'm not too worried about finding another one. 
Small Business Owner: Ugh
Small Business Owner: I’m sorry
M'aiq the Liar: That sucks
M'aiq the Liar: Hope you can get things back up and going again soon
M'aiq the Liar: Let me know if I can do anything to help
Not Stonks: Just prayers would be great
M'aiq the Liar: You got it
Not Stonks: I am most mad at Mark's betrayal and for not giving me a heads up 
M'aiq the Liar: Yeah I'd be pretty ticked too
Small Business Owner: Not a ClarisHealth or tech problem, but it’s bonkers that companies can require you to give two weeks notice when you plan on quitting but can just fire you at any time
Small Business Owner: Especially when it’s not performance based
Small Business Owner: Performance/behavior/safety based I should say
M'aiq the Liar: In most cases that's more a courtesy unless you sign a contract stipulating you have to give that notice. But courtesy also goes two ways.
Small Business Owner: I find it ironic that I’m typing all of this out with a Watto profile picture
M'aiq the Liar: Lolol
Small Business Owner: SLAVE LABOR BABYYYYYY
M'aiq the Liar: No pod is worth two slaves
Small Business Owner: @Not Stonks You should take this injustice up with the Hutts
M'aiq the Liar: Lmao stop that
Not Stonks: I even invited him to my F1 league 
M'aiq the Liar: Photo of Mark, colorized
Small Business Owner: L O L
Small Business Owner: ded 
Not Stonks: Ded
Small Business Owner: Mark rips off his mask, it’s Sri underneath. He’s like “YOU GOT ME FIRED FROM HEALTHSTREAM AND NOW ILL HAVE MY REVENGE”
M'aiq the Liar: O o f
Not Stonks: Lol
Small Business Owner: The F1 league now
Not Stonks: The number of recruiters hitting me up on LinkedIn now 
Small Business Owner: More like this @Not Stonks 
Not Stonks: When Mark wants to be a cool manager then fires people without warning 
Small Business Owner: null
Not Stonks: Ded 
M'aiq the Liar: Lol I was also thinking of making a Kenobi meme but I couldn't think of the best way to phrase it
Small Business Owner: I had to stretch for it but it kinda works hahahaha
Small Business Owner: I just know Matthew likes this format so he gives me a little brain cookie whenever I use it
Not Stonks: There is an important lesson here never tell anyone in your company that you are looking job until you have the other job locked down 
Not Stonks: And Mark left the F1 league 
M'aiq the Liar: null
Not Stonks: No refunds 
Small Business Owner: null
M'aiq the Liar: Ded
Not Stonks: In my meeting with Mark and HR 
M'aiq the Liar: Meanwhile big GroupMe still hemorrhaging members
Small Business Owner: How many are left?
M'aiq the Liar: It's not THAT fast but they're fixing to dip back under 700 again
M'aiq the Liar: From like 760 or something
M'aiq the Liar: This was my fave
Not Stonks: Oooofffff
Small Business Owner: How Sophie views her new groupme
M'aiq the Liar: I sent the Mongolian folk metal to Peter
M'aiq the Liar: POG
Small Business Owner: What mountain? Lol
M'aiq the Liar: That is a great question
M'aiq the Liar: Who knows
Not Stonks: null
Small Business Owner: Lol
