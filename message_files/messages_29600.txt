Everybody Is Good: "There's this parish in Louisville you wouldn't like. Anyone can give the homily."
Everybody Is Good: Reeeeee
Meme Lord: What....thats not how that works
Meme Lord: I feel like that might be heretical
Everybody Is Good: Well I checked and it's not specifically prohibited so it's just really illicit technically
Everybody Is Good: She also said people raise their hands for the petitions
Meme Lord: I just dont understand why....
Meme Lord: Code of Canon Law, again asserting the duty of the priest (or deacon) to preach the homily during Mass but also restricting the privilege to him alone (Canon 767). Note that lay persons may preach if necessary in certain circumstances or under special conditions outside the context of Mass (Canon 766); however, during the celebration of Mass, the privilege and duty of preaching remains with the priest alone.
Everybody Is Good: Lol
Everybody Is Good: Press F to pay respects
Everybody Is Good: I was quite happy when she said she never went to that parish again after the first time
Meme Lord: press h for heresy
Meme Lord: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Everybody Is Good: H
Meme Lord: Yeah i mean once you've gone against the Code of Canon Law I think you've crossed the line from illicit to heretical
Everybody Is Good: I was just checking the GIRM so yeah that's very very no bueno
Meme Lord: yeah I feel the GIRM would not explicitly say that's a thing you cant do
